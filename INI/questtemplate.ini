2	Welcome to Anchorville	The Human Village	Anchorville; Rembrandt	1		1				1			<Village Chief> Rembrandt	<Village Chief> Rembrandt				Welcome, Traveler, to the end of the sea. The name of this town is Anchorville. Why is it named that, you ask? Because this is where our race first anchored on the Chantra continent. The anchor of our ancestors is kept in a safe place here in town. It is our most precious treasure.</n></n>Do you want to see it? I will think about it if you hunt <HFFFA7272>6 Green Worms<HFFFFFFFF> that you will see just outside.	It is easy. Come back with <HFFFA7272>6 Green Worms<HFFFFFFFF>.	Good job. You are very talented. Anchorville always welcomes a wanderer like you.</n>I will show you the symbol of Anchorville as I promised. Wait one second.						450	Green Worm	6																																1.

There is a hole in the bottom of the box. Someone must have dug a tunnel underneath. <HFFFA7272>The guard, Yuan<HFFFFFFFF>, was patrolling the area. We'd better ask him. Ask Yuan, <HFFFA7272>west of the south gate<HFFFFFFFF>, if he saw anything.	Ask the <HFFFA7272>guard, Yuan<HFFFFFFFF>, just <HFFFA7272>west of the south gate<HFFFFFFFF>.	The chief sent you here?</n>What? The Anchor Chest disappeared? Good Heavens! What are we going to do? This is terrible! We have to figure out what to do!																																								1.

They aren't smart enough to do that on purpose, but they instinctively dig tunnels. Whatever the cause, we need to destroy those worms and retrieve the box.</n>Hunt the <HFFFA7272>Green Worms<HFFFFFFFF>, then find the <HFFFA7272>Anchor Box<HFFFFFFFF>, and take it to <HFFFA7272>Chief Rembrandt<HFFFFFFFF> at the <HFFFA7272>center of the village<HFFFFFFFF>.	The box containing the anchor is very important to us, but it might dissolve inside a Green Worm's stomach. Before that happens, catch the <HFFFA7272>Green Worms<HFFFFFFFF>, find the <HFFFA7272>Anchor Box<HFFFFFFFF>, and take it to <HFFFA7272>Chief Rembrandt<HFFFFFFFF> at the <HFFFA7272>center of the village<HFFFFFFFF>.	What an embarrassment! You have averted a great tragedy. Losing this box would have meant the end of this village. You want me to show you the anchor now?</n>I can't do that. The anchor box is firmly locked with a spell, no one has ever seen inside the box. What I promised to show you was just the box itself.</n>Well, I have saved face thanks to you. Welcome again to Anchorville!			1407	Chest Containing Anchor	1	450	Green Worm		1407	Chest Containing Anchor	25	1																												1.

They attacked me so fiercely I couldn't escape. I have to treat my wound but my bag was also taken. I don't have any more at home. If it's not too much, could you give me <HFFFA7272>1 Small Life Potion<HFFFFFFFF>, please?	Since you are a traveler you must know how precious Life Potions are. So have some empathy and give me one. I need <HFFFA7272>1 Small Life Potion<HFFFFFFFF>.	Thank you. One should do the trick for now... Finally, my bleeding has stopped and the wound is healing.

It was because of this thing. The Yellow Worm discovered it while digging in the ground. It was rolling it around like a ball. I took it with me because it seemed to be too precious to be left with a creature that does not know its worth. But I don't know anything about it either. <HFFFA7272>Chief Rembrandt<HFFFFFFFF> at the <HFFFA7272>center of the village<HFFFFFFFF> knows a lot about the village and its history, and I say we should go ask him. If you have time, deliver the <HFFFA7272>relic of Anchorville<HFFFFFFFF> to him.	Not all adventurers are good at archeology. People like me enjoy finding wealth or adventure. But things like this seem precious on the surface. So, show the <HFFFFFFFF>Relics of Anchorville<HFFFFFFFF> to <HFFFFFFFF>Chief Rembrandt<HFFFFFFFF> at the <HFFFFFFFF>center of the village<HFFFFFFFF>.	Oh, what is this all about? Are you a thief just like other people?</n></n>Umm, that's why. Kauman is an adventurer but he doesn't have enough knowledge. I wonder how many people in this village would be interested in the history of Anchorville. I will explain more about this thing in just a minute.			1426	Relics of Anchorville	1																																			1.

So it is sepulchral. It is said that they found it underground when Anchorville was built but they buried it again when they buried our ancestors. I am not exactly sure what it's for but it is from our ancestor's tomb. Of course, we should return it to them.</n>I will go since I am the only one who knows where it is. However, I want you to protect me from monsters. Hunt <HFFFA7272>7 Yellow Worms<HFFFFFFFF> <HFFFA7272>Outside the South Gate<HFFFFFFFF>. Help me to carry the relic safely!	It is very dangerous, though. It is not a task for a beginner like you. If you hunt <HFFFA7272>7 Yellow Worms<HFFFFFFFF> <HFFFA7272>Outside the South Gate<HFFFFFFFF>, that will be enough.	They are really violent, but I managed to succeed thanks to you. Anchorville has always valued tradition and we need to keep it that way. I hope you respect this while you stay here.						452	Yellow Worm	7																																1. Hunt 7 Yellow Worms.	4	2.

There is one thing you can do here.</n>Hmm. Don't be shy. Since you're doing it for me, you can feel proud of it. It is not a big deal. The Magic Stone was revealed when the sand was washed away by the Western Ocean. I've heard the Green Molds are digging for it. The Magic Stone protects Anchorville from sea monsters. I think it's because they instinctively hate the Magic Stone.</n></n>So all you need to do is kill <HFFFA7272>8 Green Molds<HFFFFFFFF> <HFFFA7272>near Pioneer's Road<HFFFFFFFF>.	You are so lazy! What are you waiting for? Get moving! Kill <HFFFA7272>8 Green Molds<HFFFFFFFF> <HFFFA7272>near Pioneer's Road<HFFFFFFFF>!	Good job. Wasn't that a simple quest?</n>The Magic Stone along the seashore was established by our ancestors. There are several other Magic Stones in various places.  One is the work of the famous Nathan Manas, though we don't know exactly where it is. The story says he used it when he fought over this village with Knozen, a Sea Dragon.</n>Don't go far. I might have other quests for you.						648	Green Mold	8																																1. Kill 8 Green Molds on Pioneer's Road.	4	2.

A deer dug up and took away a Magic Stone, and according to the rumors, it was Nathan's Magic Stone. The defensive power of that Magic Stone protects our village so this is a dangerous situation indeed.</n>Find and take down the <HFFFA7272>Deer<HFFFFFFFF> and retrieve <HFFFA7272>Anchorville's Magic Stone<HFFFFFFFF>. We don't know which deer took the stone, so you'll need to just defeat them until you find the right one. The deer are usually found <HFFFA7272>south outside the village<HFFFFFFFF>.	I was so focused on Green Molds that I overlooked other dangers. Oh, those monsters! We need to chain them together and throw them in the sea. Well, take down the <HFFFA7272>Deer<HFFFFFFFF> <HFFFA7272>south outside the village<HFFFFFFFF> and retrieve the <HFFFA7272>Anchorville Magic Stone<HFFFFFFFF>.	Oh, this is the Magic Stone?

So, show this <HFFFA7272>Magic Stone<HFFFFFFFF> to <HFFFA7272>Magic Trainer Jin Tonik<HFFFFFFFF> <HFFFA7272>west of the village<HFFFFFFFF>.	I was feeling a major change in the magical forces, and I realized it was because of the Magic Stone. If you don't put the Magic Stone back where it belongs, the defensive wall of the village will weaken gradually. Someone has to do something.</n>Me? Hohoho.

However, special work was needed to seal it in the earth because this Magic Stone has the power of fire. According to the records, Nathan Manas made it possible by offering a sacrifice. It required three Deer. You could do that, too.</n>I will perform the ritual for burying the Magic Stone and you kill <HFFFA7272>3 Deer<HFFFFFFFF> <HFFFA7272>Outside the South Gate<HFFFFFFFF>.	The sacrifice required will change depending on the situation. Sometimes birds are needed, sometimes fish. This time, we need 3 Deer .</n>I will perform the ritual for burying the Magic Stone and you kill <HFFFA7272>3 Deer<HFFFFFFFF> <HFFFA7272>Outside the South Gate<HFFFFFFFF>.	Good job.

It is the day that we put Burning Eye into a long, long sleep. You wonder what Burning Eye is? It is the name of a Huge Moth that appears east of the village. Because it has great magical power, the Alchemists regard it as a great research subject. But the thing is, the Moth rises again after two years, and we thought there must be a good reason behind this phenomenon. Recently a record was found about the Burning Eye at Delfaras. I paid a huge sum to get that record, but again, the problem was that there were a lot of monsters on the way.</n>The record will come through a land route, not a seaway.

Truthfully speaking, I'd consider selling this jar if it were valuable, but it just looks like an ordinary jar, so It's not worth it. We do need to satisfy our curiosity, though. Go to <HFFFA7272>Adventurer Kauman<HFFFFFFFF> at the <HFFFA7272>city center<HFFFFFFFF> and ask him about the jar.	What? Someone took the Maryliths' Jar? The swine. That jar is where Maryliths keep their eggs. And their chicks have deadly poison, so if you're bitten, it can be a fatal wound.</n>I need to send someone right now and find out about it.

He is not easy to get acquainted with, but we need his power to fight against the monsters. So I have sent a delegate, but he has not returned yet.

The place is at the <HFFFA7272>rock<HFFFFFFFF> near the <HFFFA7272>Pioneer's Road<HFFFFFFFF>.	I'm worried that the delegate has not come back. Captain Pack is no ordinary man.

He ordered some traps made, but recently we've used a lot of metal, so we're short on iron. We have no choice but to seek help from the Gnomes.</n>Ask <HFFFA7272>Miner Pikin Firepick<HFFFFFFFF> at the <HFFFA7272>Gnomes' Cave<HFFFFFFFF> for the metal.	These days, so many people are looking for the Archons weapons and armor are selling like crazy. So we are short of metal to make farming equipment and fishing vessels, let alone traps.  So, ask <HFFFA7272>Miner Pikin Firepick<HFFFFFFFF> at the <HFFFA7272>Gnome Cave<HFFFFFFFF> for the metal to make some traps.	What? That cad is asking me for metal? He owes me money, and he has the nerve to ask for metal? Hrm.</n>Well, I'll give you some, considering you came this far. But, these days we don't have much left because we've been receiving so many orders for Steel Ingot from everywhere. Reserve stock? Steel rusts so we don't keep much in reserve.</n>Give me a minute to think and maybe I can come up with a solution. Wait a moment.																																								1.

I forgot about it for such a long time. You know the Haunted Inn on the way to Anchorville? After the place burnt down nobody went there, so I buried a Steel Ingot in the rubble.</n>That place is dry so it probably didn't rust. Of course I wrapped it in oiled paper. That would be enough steel.</n></n>After you find the <HFFFA7272>Ingot<HFFFFFFFF> at the <HFFFA7272>Haunted Inn<HFFFFFFFF>, don't come to me but go to <HFFFA7272>Blacksmith Paparazzi, west of Delfaras Plaza<HFFFFFFFF>. By the way, when you give the Steel Ingot to Paparazzi, tell him if he doesn't immediately do what I asked of him, I will charge him a hundred times the original cost of the Steel Ingot.	He will know what I'm talking about. So find the <HFFFA7272>Steel Ingot<HFFFFFFFF> at the <HFFFA7272>Haunted Inn<HFFFFFFFF> and give it to<HFFFA7272> Blacksmith Paparazzi<HFFFFFFFF>,  <HFFFA7272>west of Delfaras Plaza<HFFFFFFFF>.	Oh, you brought the Steel Ingot. Thank you. I wonder why Pikin Firepick gave you the steel so readily.</n>I knew it. He attached conditions to the steel.

Would you do it in my place?</n>You seem like a good fighter. If you did it for me, I would be greatly appreciative. I would be indebted to you if you were to kill <HFFFA7272>12 Young Direwolves<HFFFFFFFF> at <HFFFA7272>Round Peak<HFFFFFFFF>.	I am pretty strong but I have never wielded a weapon. So I am an awkward fighter. Therefore, kill <HFFFA7272>12 Young Direwolves<HFFFFFFFF> at <HFFFA7272>Round Peak<HFFFFFFFF>.	You are indeed a brave traveler. I should have asked you in the first place. Of course, I won't just ask you for small favors all the time.</n>I'll keep in mind that the quest should be worth your effort, the next time I ask for a favor.

The reason we needed to make the trap was to catch Young Direwolves at the mountain path east of Delfaras. Ask <HFFFA7272>Guild Registrar Luciano <HFFFA7272>south of the city plaza, before doing something useless.	If he goes ahead with setting the trap, we can't do anything about it. But if he doesn't, we shouldn't use this rare metal in making useless traps. Ask <HFFFA7272>Guild Registrar Luciano<HFFFFFFFF>, <HFFFA7272>south of the city plaza<HFFFFFFFF>.	I heard the news about the young Direwolves being killed. Are you the one who killed all of them? Now everyone can pass by with no worries.</n></n>As he said, we don't need traps anymore since the young Direwolves were all wiped out. You saved me a lot of time.

I lost the document that opens the Golden Road. I kept it safe, but I think the monsters snuck in and took it.</n>As they have the document in their hands, they will be preparing to open the Golden Road quickly. We need to move before they do. I asked Guard Angus to follow the monsters to see how the situation is proceeding. Check with <HFFFA7272>Guard Angus<HFFFFFFFF>, <HFFFA7272>east of the south gate of the village<HFFFFFFFF>.	I told the guard Angus all about what's going on. He's got an attitude problem sometimes but he is cautious in dangerous situations, so I'm sure he's very nervous right now.

There must be a solution.</n>Phew, we need to remain calm. We went to the Gold Road, and went through some scary moments; and as the chief said, the monsters seem to be preparing to open the Gold Road. The huge Viper King Midas was there. As soon as I saw him, I ran away, so I don't know what happened after that. My legs are shaking again. Let's talk later.																																								1.

What were they doing? I don't know but there was light shining everywhere and they seemed to be performing a ritual. We need to stop that? There are things I can do and things I cannot do. I believe in this case, it is the latter.</n></n>What? You want to go? You're crazy. Midas is different from other Vipers. Still you want to fight him? Are you going to kill him?</n>Okay, okay. Go to the <HFFFA7272>Golden Road<HFFFFFFFF> and defeat <HFFFA7272>Viper King Midas<HFFFFFFFF> if you can. If you succeed, go to <HFFFA7272>Chief Rembrandt<HFFFFFFFF> at the <HFFFA7272>center of the village<HFFFFFFFF>.	It would be impossible.

Well, go to the <HFFFA7272>Golden Road<HFFFFFFFF>, defeat the <HFFFA7272>Viper King Midas<HFFFFFFFF>, and then go to <HFFFA7272>Chief Rembrandt<HFFFFFFFF> at the <HFFFA7272>center of the village<HFFFFFFFF>.	Oh, you've defeated Midas! As Midas was at the center of the ritual, with his death, the ritual has failed. Good job.

A long time ago, the Sea People sealed Jamushi's evil spirit there. When Delfaras was being built, our tribe sealed the place once again, keeping our promise with the Sea People. Recently, I heard something strange from <HFFFA7272>Pilgram Nox<HFFFFFFFF> who is studying there. Go to Nox.	He does not guard that place but he has been managing it for a long time.

This began when a Young Lycanto named Rojin appeared. He is different from the others. I don't know exactly, but he seems to be very driven.</n>Anyway, I don't think it will be easy for them to destroy Jamushi's Seal but I am still worried about it. First, Kill <HFFFA7272>12 Young Lycantoes<HFFFFFFFF> <HFFFA7272>East of Jamushi's Seal<HFFFFFFFF>.	We don't need to sit here flapping our jaws.

We need to ask for repair at Delfaras, but we have to make one thing clear. It doesn't make sense to repair Jamushi's Seal with Delfaras' budget when it is the Young Lycantos that destroyed the place.</n>I have a good idea. I know where Young Lycanto Rojin hid his money. I heard he received a money pouch with a thousand Gold and hid it. I think it's okay for us to use that money. Steal the <HFFFA7272>1000 Gold Pouch<HFFFFFFFF> under the <HFFFA7272>rock<HFFFFFFFF> near <HFFFA7272>Triangle Village<HFFFFFFFF>.	Regardless of the reason, stealing is not good, so I would pay for the cost if I could. For a random wanderer a day's pay would be enough. However, I do not have enough money. So, steal the <HFFFA7272>Gold Pouch<HFFFFFFFF> under the <HFFFA7272>rock<HFFFFFFFF> near <HFFFA7272>Triangle Village<HFFFFFFFF>.	Good job! Lycanto have their own culture, so they need money too. It's not strange for them to keep money, but there are rumors that someone gave them that money for a specific purpose. Perhaps the money paid for the attack on Jamushi's Seal. Well, we need to take some things to Delfaras including this money, so hold on a second.																				132711129	1195	1000 Gold Pouch	1																	1.

He's very cunning.</n>I cannot stay here any longer. This may become a bigger problem later on, so let's root out this issue now. Go <HFFFA7272>east of the Jamushi's Seal<HFFFFFFFF> and defeat the <HFFFA7272>Young Lycanto Rojin<HFFFFFFFF>.	Rojin clearly has different powers than other Young Lycantos. We need to be extremely careful. Go <HFFFA7272>east of the Jamushi's Seal<HFFFFFFFF> and defeat <HFFFA7272>Young Lycanto Rojin<HFFFFFFFF>.	It is said Pilgrims shouldn't kill, but there are things more important than mere words.

The coach was destroyed and most of the soldiers were killed. But most of the Lizardmen Soldiers also died and the rest escaped. We were able to evacuate what was left of our soldiers to the cave, but the Gold Nugget Chest was left at the seashore. The soldiers hid it there so it wouldn't be stolen.

Commander Marco sent you here. I heard you're looking for Zian's Proof. I first heard about it from my grandmother. Zian's Proof was prepared by Zian Manas in the event of his death. Zian lived alone, and did not have any descendants.

The Lizardman Soldiers around here have hidden something carefully. Nobody knows what it is. When I heard about it from Commander Marco, I thought it might be worth finding out. Zian Manas stayed here in Gypsy Town for 6 months. He might have hidden a Proof while he was here. Maybe it's valuable to the Lizardmen.</n>It sounds crazy, but it is a fact that they have a cherished treasure. The problem is the location, because we don't have a Map. My grandmother said something vague about the location long ago, maybe we should start searching there. Let me check it out because you are not familiar with this area.

I heard someone destroyed Largefoot, and I thought it would be you.  Until you came, there really haven't been any strong travelers here. Anyway, why did you defeat him? What do you need?</n>The Talisman of Secret Observation? No wonder everyone is reluctant to talk about it. From an alchemist's point of view, the talisman is a very useful thing. If you bury the Talisman of Secret Observation under a rock or trees, it can spy on a wide area surrounding that point. In other words, no one's privacy is safe. So that's why adults, who have many sins, are so reluctant to talk about it.

Even if it's not poison, the sap smells different from previous years and the color is opaque. However, we can't go collect it again. Life Sap can be extracted from the tree only once a year.

Not many people know the geography of that area, so I think it is better for a traveler like you to go there.	There are a few ways the sap can get contaminated. For example, if the carrier of the sap has bad intentions in his mind, or when a person with a sin touches the sap, and so on. In fact, I don't know what each soldier is up to, so there is no way to find out what happened. In the end, it's my fault because I didn't manage the soldiers properly.

222	A New Wave	Rumors from Everywhere	Tullan; Cutty	3		27				1			<Mayor> Cutty	<Adventurer> Lariat				Tullan has undergone several bloody wars since the Humans settled here. The struggles have been about conquering the fertile lands of Tullan. The biggest war was the war against Ellanjeans, and the Hundred Day War between Zian and Ugdrasil a century ago. But young men in the castle will remember when Usus attacked a year ago. The alliance between Humans and Orcs are now chasing Usus under an agreement they signed half a year ago. But they've yet to see any fruitful results. It's not easy to distinguish truth from rumors brought in by travelers. Adventurer Lariat, east inside the city, knows a lot more about this kind of news. Go ask him if he's heard any news recently.	When we were attacked by Usus a year ago, the villagers were overly dependent on rumors for their news. But we should't give too much credence to all these stories floating around. There's only a grain of truth in those rumors, and it is the power of truth that allows one to distinguish fact from fiction. Adventurer Lariat, East inside the city, possesses such power. Go and ask him whether he has received any real news.	I hear useless rumors, but today I heard something I would like to share with you. Will you tell me your name? Don't be suspicious. I just want to check something. Oh, yes. As long as you who you say you are, you deserve to listen to the story I've heard. Wait a moment.																																								1.

Although the plan was not implemented, he also had a plan to use the power of fallen soldiers from a century ago. To implement the plan, Usus brought back something called the Undead's Symbol, a source of enormous power using the essence of wandering souls. But for some reason, he didn't use the Symbol and didn't take it back with him when he left Tullan. In other words, that Symbol is hidden somewhere in Tullan. So I will look into this information, and I need your help. It would be of much help to me if you could get me a Wolf Potion. You can get it by using alchemy or through other means.	I can't understand the Zombie's language, but if I change into a Wolf, I will be able to observe them while staying close to them. So, it would be a huge help to me if you could get me a Wolf Potion. You can get it by using alchemy or through other means, I don't care as long as I get the potion!	Oh, you've brought it back. If I can gain a lot of information by drinking this potion, then I don't think I should feel guilty drinking it.

We could have gotten precious materials from the Zombies, but they discovered our attempted disguise. Running away is the best we can do in such a situation. That's the only way we could save our lives.</n>But, I'm sure I left tracks. If I don't do anything, it's just a matter of time before they follow the traces to attack this city.</n></n>I know to address this problem easily. No matter how many of them would attack us, we should get rid of <HFFFA7272>17 Zombie Leaders<HFFFFFFFF> <HFFFA7272>near Shump Village<HFFFFFFFF>. The number 17 has a magical power. It will neutralize all the undeads' abilities within a certain range, although the effect will be temporary.	I know I'm asking this for my own sake, but please get rid of <HFFFA7272>17 Zombie Leaders<HFFFFFFFF> <HFFFA7272>near Shump Village<HFFFFFFFF>. Make sure you get 17 of them!	That was a close call. Thanks to you, I'm safe. The information I received from the Zombies? I will try my best to find out from now on. The Symbol was hidden for such a long time, so I can't see it unless I disperse all the curses wrapped around the Symbol. So we need to wait until the right time. Oh, you want to know why I asked you your name? A traveler from the East said he heard of the Undead's Symbol from your teacher. The traveler conveyed the message and said to engage you in the quest when you arrived at Tullan. So I just did my job. Do you understand now?

Although he accepted the existence of monsters, he thought the Undead didn't belong in Tullan since they were wandering between life and death. Recently, however, they appear frequently. I'm afraid this means they gained more power than Regen's charms can ward off. Collect information from villagers to help us verify the situation. Guard Arian always guards the plains, so he must know something about this. He's patrolling the south gate of the city.

There are so many people that they're suffering from a shortage of armor and weapons. If you take it, even the General will notice you.	I sense hesitation down in your heart.

In the King's Hunting Field, there's a tent His Majesty's ancestors used now and again. He didn't use it much, but kept it in place to help maintain the Grounds. Well, prior to carrying out our plan, we ordered our men to go there and bring back anything valuable so that we could keep it safe. Unfortunately, they were attacked by monsters and lost two items. Go find the Young Dreadwolves outside the east gate of Tullan and bring back the Old Operational Map, that's one of the two items.	Young Dreadwolves are ferocious beasts. We never know when they'll tear up the things they've taken, so please hurry. Go to the Young Dreadwolves outside the east gate of Tullan and bring back the Old Operational Map from them.

Go west of the King's Hunting Field, defeat the Shadow Bears and retrieve the Old Hunting Record.	We all have things we value. Sometimes it's valued universally by everyone. Sometimes it can be relative, meaning it only holds value for us. His Majesty's Old Hunting Record is the latter. So stop messing around. Go west of the King's Hunting Field, defeat the Shadow Bears and retrieve the Old Hunting Record.	Good job. This finalizes the main preparations.

334	Dangerous Book	Far Away Dispatch	Tullan; Beacon	1		37				1			<General> Beacon	<Elder> Mybling				We have a problem. One of the valuables from inside the palace has been stolen. It's called the 'Book of Havoc.'  It's a one-of-a-kind book that lists all the powerful magic that has been secretly researched in the palace. Last night, the Spriggans stole it. We responded swiftly and searched the headquarters of the Spriggans, but haven't found it yet.  After questioning the Spriggans, we found out that one of them went to Ellore with the book. He plans to go to the east using a portal. Entering the land of the Orcs is a very delicate matter, so we're carefully preparing a plan.  You're not one of us, but please go find the Book of Havoc. First go to Elder Mybling at the western entrance of Ellore. I've already talked to him.	We'd almost finished creating our plan and were debating who to send.  That's when you showed up. Go to Elder Mybling at the western entrance of Ellore. I've already spoken him.	General Beacon told me someone was coming to see me.

That's why you have to go first to Ezerock through Silancium in the eastern area. When you arrive, be careful not to wander around too much and don't cause trouble. From there, go to Trilgard, the city of Orcs, and find Mayor Prosto, at the east end of the city. Tell him the situation. It would be rude to go empty-handed, so let me tell you what to get. You'll see a tree when you go south of the Prince's Hunting Field. That tree covers the Earth's Eye. Find it and bring it to the Mayor of Trilgard to get his help.	Security Chief Koop, who rules over Zylok, isn't someone you can reason with. Go to Trilgard in Ezerock and find Mayor Prosto east of the city. Don't forget to take the Earth's Eye, which can be found in the roots of a tree south of the Prince's Hunting Field. Prosto will help you.	The Earth's Eye represents your affection for us.

We cherish the Water Elemental, so making the Earth Elemental angry is always a possibility. That's why, for generations, we've learned various ways of appeasing the Earth Elemental. Go to Archer Armor Merchant Noviel southeast of the city and ask her for the solution.	Actually, I was the one who urged her to hunt the Forest Buckets, so I should be punished as well.

According to the Scouts, the Spriggans have hidden the Shield in one of the tents in Redderhood.  It's so ordinary-looking that it can easily be overlooked. Go there and bring back the King's Shield.	You offered your service, so don't run away. Go get the King's Shield from one of the tents in Redderhood. And don't get caught.	Oh, you brought it back! You're amazing.

All the soldiers of Tullan will go and recapture the King's Hunting Field, but first there's something we must do. Spriggan's were born from magic, so they're close to sorcerers of the dark. They've put a Talisman of Binding inside one of the tents in the Quilt Camp in order to help take the King's Hunting Field. This will make soldiers approaching redderhood feel heavy and eventually lock up their whole body. I ask you to steal the Talisman. A man of your skills should be able to do it.	Unless you move quickly, my men will be in trouble. Hurry up and bring the Talisman of Binding from one of the tents in the Quilt Camp.	So this is it.

It seems the defenders have been imprisoned within Redderrhood by the Spriggans. I don't know how, but I think they found out about our plan. Two of the partisans are my best commanders. If we send in our troops, they'll surely kill the soldiers.  We need to move with caution, which is why I must request your services again. Go to Redderhood and kill the Spriggan Lord Bouldo.  That will make his men disperse and help our defenders escape. Help us!	The Spriggans aren't very patient but they are violent. If we don't do something, the partisans will all die. Not only is each and every one of them important, but I also don't want to lose the main force of Tullan.  So go to Redderhood and take down the Spriggan Lord Bouldo.	All of Tullan is indebted to you! Thanks to you, my men came back to life. What you did was the most noble act possible for us humans and the whole of Tullan. We'll celebrate your heroic act forever.

I wonder if anyone will accompany me. I'm not very good at it, so people don't like to come along with me. I've sent letters to different people, but haven't received any replies, so I think you'll need to accompany me. But first, go to the Adventurer Lariat east of the city and ask him if he'll go with me. Be sure to take a Morningstar for him. I said I'd give him one if he went hunting with me.	Everyone's busy, so please hurry. Get a Morningstar and deliver it to Adventurer Rope east of the city.  Then ask him what he thinks.	Oh, my. So finally it's resulted in this, eh? I guess I have no choice since I really want that Morningstar. I'm actually too busy to assist the mayor,  but I guess I should since you brought the gift and all. Still, we have a problem, which I'll tell you about later. Don't go far, just wait here.			41	Morningstar	1																																			1. Get a Morningstar.	11	2.

Mayor Cutty takes all day when he goes out hunting.  Of course, he's using his vacation, but people like us can't afford to do that. Plus, I can't leave for a whole day when my eagle-eyed wife is watching me. So I promised to go with him just for the morning. The rest of the day, I've asked Trigger to help out, but I'm not sure this will work. I promised to bring him the Arrow of Accuracy from one of the tents in the Quilt Camp. What? You'll get it for me? Really?  Oh, please do. Then take it to Hunter Trigger southwest of the city.	What are you still doing here? I'm busy, and I can't deal with you any longer. So go to the Quilt Camp and find the Arrow of Accuracy in one of the tents. Then go to Hunter Trigger South West of the city.	Hey.  This is the Arrow of Accuracy, isn't it? I've been looking for it and you just brought it to me just like this. What do you want from me? Oh, I'd almost forgotten about it. I see.

He says there's something Mayor Cutty asked of you. The mayor's asked an archery Weapons Merchant a favor to aid his hunting. Well, he wants you to see how it's going, but only under one condition. Archery Weapons Merchant Ermellen, just South East of the city is asking for one Manticore Potion in return. She won't accept Gold, so I guess you will need to find the potion.	Hey, people are waiting for you. What are you doing here like this? Go to Archery Weapons Merchant Ermellen, just southeast of the city and give her a Manticore Potion.	You came to get the mayor's bow? There's no other reason you'd give me a Manticore Potion. Thank you. Yes, I have the weapon the mayor wanted, but before I give it to you, there's one favor I must ask. Let me figure out how to put this.			1034	Manticore Potion	1																																			1.

I wanted to present it as it is, but my pride as an artisan just won't allow it. Hmm? Oh, the problem is that the bow I've made for the Mayor is a special western-style that I polished myself. I think the Mayor deserves to use a bow of such quality, but I want to adorn a very important part of the bow with a gem and I know the perfect one. It's not mine, but it's on the forehead of some statue out in the fields. Hey, I need your help. Go to the plains south of Beacon Village and get the Emerald of Concentration from the Horuse Statue.	The Horuse Statue was created to commemorate those who died in the war against Ellanjeans. The people of Tullan won't get close to it because they consider it unlucky. It's only a superstition, so don't worry too much. We trust the Elementals, so stop shaking. Go to the plains south of Beacon Village and get the Emerald of Concentration from the Horuse Statue.	Yes, this is the emerald. Look at how it sparkles. With this Emerald of Concentration, the bow will be reborn. Good job.

He's a merchant, so I'm sure he'll release Dolce if you give him something valuable, and I know something he wants. There's a tomb of the ancients southwest of Tullan. There's a Broken Coffin there with an Ancient Perfume inside. I hear the perfume gives off a scent incomparable to anything in the world. I'm sure Goldilocks will like it.  Take the Perfume to Caravan Goldilocks southwest of the city.	Goldbeard is brutal to those who steal his things. Sometimes he privately executes them or sells them as slaves to foreign ships. Of course, I trust Dolce didn't steal anything, but this is our only choice since we can't prove his innocence. Find the Ancient Perfume from the Broken Coffin southwest of Tullan and deliver it to Blacksmith Goldbeard southwest of the city.	Oh, this smells amazing! It's definitely the Ancient Perfume! Where did you find it? What? You're giving it to me? But I'm a merchant, I know nothing in this world is free. Tell me what you want in return. Hmm, so you think Dolce is innocent and he should be released. I'll think about it.

He asked the villagers to search the forest and they found out it was taken by Bolko, who lives in the Dead Torges Forest. Torges who disrupt their society are exiled there, hence the name but a Rain Torge named Bolko, who was exiled there a few years ago, managed to gather other Torges into a Empire of his own. Apparently he started using the Symbol of Darkness as his source of power. Those living in the forest must help others maintain order. According to the merchant, Bolko put the Symbol of Darkness under the torchlight in the Dead Arbor Forest. I'd like you to retrieve the Symbol of Darkness, please.	I know it's a difficult task, but it's worth it to keep order in the forest.  Be careful. Find the Symbol of Darkness under the torchlight in the Dead Arbor Forest.	Just looking at it makes me flinch. I think the Elementals will be angry if we leave it in this forest any longer, but it does belong to the traveler, so we'll have to keep it until he comes for it. Oh, I forgot to thank you.  But it's not over yet. Bolko's still alive.

Hmm, you believe the story? Yes, you believe it? Well, your eyes certainly suggest you're not lying. Let me get to the point anyway. The guilds that I highly respect say one of their members is missing. We often go searching for missing people, but the problem is that this time, it's the grandson of a Tullan nobleman. They're telling me to find traces of his disappearance somehow or other. So just pretend you're doing a good deed and help me out. Go outside to the tree southwest of the village and look for anything he might have had at the time he disappeared. For example, a bow. He was an archer, you know.	They say no one needs to be scared in Ellore, but I often go to the big city on business. So please go to the tree southwest outside the village and look for something like a bow.	Oh, you found it.

I guess it's been handed down generation after geneartion. Where is it? Well, I didn't just lay here wasting time. I pressed the guild members and got some information. Apparently he died because of the Rain Torges. Rain Torges kill those who invade the forest. They never eat them, but they do tend to collect war trophies. What I'm saying is chances are good they have what the nobleman is looking for, got it? So go northwest out of Ellore, destroy the Rain Torges and bring back the Gleaming Ring.	What? Are you hesitating because you don't trust me? Go on. Go northwest out of Ellore, destroy the Rain Torges and bring back the Gleaming Ring.	Is this what the nobleman wanted us to find?

You seem to be hesitating because I said it's a map. But it's a very important map. It describes in detail how Le Sidul's roots have spread throughout Shinewood. As long as we have this map, we can take care of Le Sidul forever. There's a reason we hid it in the stump of Ceredul, Le Sidul's brother tree. We don't have to discuss it right now.

I used to patrol Ellore, but I fell in love with the beautiful scenery and people of Ellore and ended up settling down there. Still, it doesn't change the fact that I'm still from Tullan. I recently got an order from Tullan to steal an important item from this village. How can I betray them like that? But if I disobey an order, I might pay with my life. There are quite a few Tullan spies here disguised as travelers. So I think I'll have to try to trick them. You'll help me, won't you? I know you fell in love with Ellore and Shinewood as well. First, I need to pretend I'm working. I'll make noise like I'll be going out soon. Meanwhile, get three Maces for me. I need to at least pretend that I’m doing some digging.	What are you doing? You might be suspected as a conspirator, so don't mess up. Get me three Maces!	Good. They're good quality. Too bad I won't be using them. What a shame. Right. Well, thank you.

Like I said, Tullan wants me to bring back a certain item. The treasure of Ellore! But they don't know what it is. Of course, I don't, either. Anyway, I need to give them something and I was trying to think of what would work. Then a great idea suddenly came to mind. There's a tree in the lower part of Salarmis Garden. I saw some kind of document between the branches. I don't know who hid it there, but I think it's been there for quite a long time. Bring me that document. The content? Who cares? Neither the people of Tullan nor we know what the real treasure of Ellore is. Got it?	What are you worried about? You want to know about the document? I don't know what it is, but I'm sure it's not as important as Ellore's treasure. Come on, we're talking about something no one has any idea about, but your job is simple.

A few days ago, I heard a rumor that a traveler found a staff that has great magic power at the site in Woodcutter Pass. When Lingdin heard this, she said it was probably her ancestors' staff. I was supposed to deliver it to her, but I could not even go near the object because of its strong magic power. This is why I'd like to ask a favor of you. Please go and find the staff at the site and deliver it to Archer weapon merchant Lingdin in the Northwest of the village.	Rumors of a staff with great magic power have existed for a long time.

Unfortunately, he was eaten by a monster on his way back. Not only am I disturbed because I lost one of my men, but also because I lost the evidence.  You must bring it here to me.

I found out who caused the problem in Silancium. The owner of this pendant is a citizen of Ellanjeans. As you know, Ellanjeans is a country that's been in conflict with Tullan for hundreds of years. I personally don't care about the politics, but I need to finish what I started. It seems the people of Ellanjeans are developing a new weapon to attack Tullan. I think you should ask Gyslot to confirm that fact. He's from Ellanjeans, so he probably has connections. Go to Traveler Gyslot, east of the village, and ask him about this incident.	It's a sensitive issue, so don't force him to talk. Go to Traveler Gyslot east of the village and ask him about the incident.	Hey, what's this? You suddenly show up and ask me questions? I'm from Ellanjeans, but I'm currently living in Ellore. So...  Hmm, I can't deny that I have information. This pendant belongs to my friend Beoul, the coyote. He's in charge of developing new weapons using gunpowder.  Recently, I heard he was killed during one of his experiments. It's top secret for fear Tullan would find out, but you're already aware of it.  Maybe the conflict betwen the two countries will keep going, which doesn't concern me. That's all. Would you please give me the pendant? He used to be my buddy, so I'd like him to rest in peace.																																								1.

So I've decided to save the Guild Master first. Here's my plan. We'll go hunting and fake his death, pretending he's been killed by monsters. We can't bring any guild members along on this hunting trip, or they'll figure it out right away. So I considered going alone with him, but that might look suspicious. I have to ask you to join us. Are you sure you want to help us? What a loyal traveler you are. Let me tell you what part you'll play in the plan. It's pretty straightforward. Just hunt thirty-five Lamia Ladies in Ghost Valley. That should be enough.	You'll help us a lot just by destroying thirty-five Lamia Ladies in Ghost Valley. Please! Ghost Valley is to the far east from here.	Oh, that's hard.

Silancium and Windrill in the northern area are both incredibly barren. The magic storm that hit Windrill dried out Silancium as well. The blessings of the Elementals are the only thing that keep Shinewood so bountiful. That's why the people of Shinewood are always thankful and work hard to preserve the woods. They're also working to restore Silancium so it's always green. Strangers don't realize it, but every year a group makes sure Le Sidul's sap is passed on to trees in Silancium. But this year, it seems the person in charge didn't do a very good job. I'd like you to go check. Bring the Sap Pot from under the roots of the tree in the Ghost Valley.	The tree sucks up the sap from the Sap Pot and grows leaves. The animals then eat these leaves and become prey to other predators.  That's how life is sustained in Chantra, spreading the blessed energy of Shinewood little by little into Silancium. Well, that's what the plan is anyway. That's why the Sap Pot has been buried there. Go to the tree in the Ghost Valley, dig up the Sap Pot from under its roots and bring it back to me.	Let me see. Give me the Sap Pot... That's weird.

Have to keep up my professional reputation. But they'll be back, and they'll kill me if I stand in their way again. To be honest, I'd give them the item, but I don't have the key I need. As usual, I gave the key to the traveler. The thieves said some monsters took the key. They want me to break open the safe. I can't do that. Can you search for the key?

Shinewood is absolutely peaceful, but they're threatening the travelers in Silancium. As a Shinewood resident, I live by the principle of ‘leave everything be,' but I can't just leave this matter as it is. The monsters will just cause more problems. I may be acting against the will of the Elementals, but I'll intervene in their conflicts at this point. Of course, I can't handle this situation by myself, so I need your help. What do you think? It's good we have the same opinion. Destroy thirty Redflag Raiders on the Hawks' Plateau.	Things should be done step by step. Destroy thirty Redflag Raiders at the Hawk's Plateau first and don't hurry.	Thank you, but this is just the beginning.

The conflict among Monsters started from the item that belonged to Carlyle, the head of Redflag Raiders. Monsters call the item the 'Supreme Ring,' but I have no idea what that is.

If Risky gets through the open gate and steals the ring again, everything we've done so far will be in vain. You have to defeat Risky in the Death Plains! Everything will be fine if you catch him and prevent anyone else from touching the gates.	Risky on the Death Plains will be hard to kill, but I'm sure you are up to the task at hand.

According to some rumors, she's following a traveler in a black robe. I heard she left everything behind in Silancium when she took up with him. If that's true, she must have left behind the Medicine of Immortal Life. I want to get it from her belongings, but I need more information. I recently heard Traveler Elba talking about Basarah with a traveler from the east. Go to Traveler Elba in front of the south gate of the village and ask her. Pretend you're just happening by.	Don't forget. Go to Traveler Elba in front of the south gate of the village.	Oh, do you know the story? So far it remains to be confirmed.

I've heard so many stories, I can't remember clearly. Oh, yes. Now I remember the story about the Medicine of Immortal Life. I heard the map of where it was hidden is somewhere under a rock West of Death Plains. He said the Map was hidden there. It can be just a rumor, so I can't guarantee it.	Do you want me to tell you one more time? Bring the Map from under a rock west of the Death Plains, if it is there.	Wow, was it really there? Amazing. Can I see it? Wow, this is great. I envy you.

It acts as a boundary with Silancium and gives water to every plant in Shinewood. The water of the lake is sinking very slowly. We don't know why it's happening, but I think the monsters in Silancium are planning something. They live in the eastern part, so that's the direction they'll come from. We may find some evidence near there. The monsters would use a Talisman of Absorption. Can you help me? Find the Talisman of Absorption under a rock east of Angspel Lake and give it to Judge Fariannel north of the village.	There's a possibility you won't find it there, but my instinct tells me you will. Find the Talisman of Absorption under a rock east of Angspel Lake and give it to Judge Fariannel north of the village.	I heard it from Mybling.

The names of various places even originate from that problem. Wanderer Plain is an example. This area in Silancium is especially dry, so travelers often get dehydrated and wander around in a daze. Experienced travelers are prepared for it, but there are always unskilled ones from Tullan who are never heard from again. Ironically that's because so many people travel here from Tullan to search for their friends who were lost in the desert. If we ignore this problem, Ellore will turn into one big crowd of mourning, ill-prepared travelers vying for the chance to be the next ones to go missing. I cannot express the degree to which they are bothering me. As an Elder, I have to solve this problem as soon as possible. I asked Traveler Elba at the south gate of the village to help me, but I don't think she'll be able to manage it alone. She can only join one search party at a time. Help her, please!

Well, have you heard of Windrill, a desert north of Silancium? Huge sandstorms blow clear from there to Silancium through the western mouth of Windrill this time of the year. These sandstorms are called Wing Typhoons. The sand in the air gets so thick no one can see or hear anything. All of Silancium gets covered in dust. Every year it causes many deaths. The rest of the year we seal the entrance of Windrill with Wind Stopping Magic to help make Silancium more habitable. But if we try to stop the Wing Typhoons it interferes with the power of the Elementals, so the seal is released when the Wing Typhoon begins to blow and now is the time. Can you do it for me? Anyone can do it, but you're here at the moment. Thank you. Get the Magic Seal from a rock near the western mouth of Windrill and bring it to me.	This isn't a complicated job.

It's sad he died, but I really need that Magic Seal. As I said, permanently stopping the wind is going against the wisdom of the Elementals. We can make a new Seal, but it won't be completed until next year, and it's already too late. Can you do me a favor thats kind of difficult? Destroy the Black Hawkarrows in the Lufut Land  and retrieve the Servant's Bag. It was a small hip sack, so a Black Hawkarrow must have swallowed it.

Some say it's just a legend, but it is a truth in the documents of the Elementals. Brambattle is sleeping deep in the desert and it will wake up someday. I saw something strange in the desert today. I saw someone preparing for a magical ceremony, so I got close to him. He attacked me, then tried to run away. I caught him without any difficulties and interrogated him. He told me surprising things. The traveler in the black robe gave him directions and he was carrying out one of the revival ceremonies for Brambattle. It was hard to believe such nonsense, but his behavior was too systematic and careful to be that of a madman. I want to see if what he said was the truth or not. According to him, a Talisman of Weather is attached to a rock in the Fallen Hills Area. If it's there, I'll believe him. Can you bring it?	Bring back the Talisman of Weather from a rock in the Fallen Hills Area, please.	You brought it. Give it to me. Hmm, this is the Talisman of Weather.

I can't even carry out my research. I need bat material from time to time, so I don't really mind, but Warrior Weapons Merchant Mecante asked me for help because of the Giant Bats. So I made this Bat-Repelling Perfume after a great deal of effort, and now I need to apply it around the village. Deliver this perfume to Warrior Weapons Merchant Mecante southeast inside the village.	Mecante will be waiting for you. Deliver this Bat-Repelling Perfume to Warrior Weapons Merchant Mecante southeast inside the village. He will use it wisely.	Bat-Repelling Perfume? It has a smell that repels even us!

522	Let's Drive Away Rockbole!	The End of the Hunt	Golundo; Tickle	1		3				2			<Adventurer> Tickle	<Magic Trainer> Trujillo				Have you heard of Rockbole? That's the name of a Rock Spider living north of the village. It's not an ordinary Rock Spider. It was created to protect an ancient magic long, long ago. But even after the magic disappeared, its instinct still survives to this day. Long ago, it was as big as a house, but fortunately it is much smaller now. Still, it poses grave problems for the villagers, and many have suffered. It will be difficult to defeat him with our bare hands as it is locked in magic. So I asked Trujillo to find a way to defeat it. I think he's had time to come up with a way, so go to Magic Trainer Trujillo south of the village.	I asked him to do it a long time ago, so he must have made some progress. Stop being lazy and go to Magic Trainer Trujillo south inside the village.	Oh, right. I've heard about it. But what can I do? I've been so busy I couldn't even get on that project. I don't like Tickle because he's so arrogant. Well, if you can stop him from showing off, then I will think about it.																																								1.

What does a traveler like you know about this village? To tell you the truth, I'm almost finished with the research he asked me to do. In fact, it is complete. But I can only tell you if you do something for me first. What I want you to do is hunt deer. Kill five Deer west of the Zeno Plain. The deer are ruining my vegetable garden. You will have to go to the Zeno Plain to kill them.	You reap what you sow. Destroy five Deer west of the Zeno Plains.

As long as it has the Earth's Eye, it can revive. Now you have the answer. Find the Earth's Eye under a rock near the Zeno Plains and take it to Adventurer Tickle north inside the village. Then convey my message that the Earth's Eye is now gone, so he can hunt freely.	Be quick. If you dawdle like that, the monster will bite you. Find the Earth's Eye under a rock near the Zeno Plains and take it to Adventurer Tickle, north inside the village.	Hmm, what is this? What? Earth's Eyes? Why did he send this? Oh, is that so? It was simpler than I'd thought. Then I can hunt now, right? Okay, okay.																				172294451	1562	Eye of Earth	1																	1.

Hurry up, go, go.	Don't forget he was once huge, but stay cool and you can kill him. Go to southwest of the Zeno Plain and defeat the Rock Spider Rockbole and bring back the Rockbole's Claw.	Is this Rockbole's Claw!? This is a perfect symbol to remind me of my adventure! What? Your adventure?

Someone must have taken them outside the village. A villager most likely. I'm most suspicious of Merchant Zion. I heard he made lots of money by buying and selling relics before he came here. Go and question him. He's in the center of the village.	The more I think about it, the more suspicious I am about Zion. Go question him in the center of the village.	What are you here for? What?

To live in this village comfortably, you need to help your neighbors. So defeat five Green Molds near the Tomb of the Dead.	Hmm, good job.

Of course the weapons aren't inside this village. It's too dangerous to keep them here, and if you were me, would you keep them here? I hid the box under a rock at the Tomb of the Dead. Find the box that contains the ancestor's weapons and take them to the Warrior Weapons Merchant Mecante southeast just inside the village.	I want to make him worry longer, but I really don't have a choice. Find the box containing the ancestor's weapons under a rock at the Tomb of the Dead and take it to Warrior Arms Merchant Mecante southeast just inside the village.	Bastard! If the weapons aren't safe, I'll kill Zion! If the box is empty by any chance, I'll force him to pay for them, so stay there a moment.																				172360037	1415	Box Containing Ancestor's Weapon	1																	1.

Sometimes people earn lots of money while hunting Bats because the Cave Bats sometimes go to that cave and accidentally pick up gold on their bodies. According to the rumors, one of the Cave Bats living south of Crowcross has a Ring on its toe. The Ring must have gotten on the toe by accident. So the owner of that Ring should be me, Morien. I will put it up for sale on the open market and probably receive a high price for it. So defeat the Cave Bat and bring the Ring to me.	Isn't it a simple quest? Destroy the Cave Bat living south of Crowcross and bring me back the Ring.	It's very difficult to get one, so I'm well aware of how much effort you put into this quest. Good job!

So it wasn't a bat that had the Ring on after all. Whatever it was, it became a bat because it wore the Ring. Will I destroy the ring? Are you out of your mind? I got this after going through a lot of trouble. Well, after YOU went through a lot of trouble, to be exact. Hrmph, I can't sell this as it is, so run to Magic Trainer Trujillo and ask him how to purify the Ring. He is just south of the village.	What, do you want to see me change into a bat?! That's not right! Hurry up and run to Magic Trainer Trujillo just south of the village and ask him how to purify this Ring!	That foolish thing. He has gotten himself into trouble once again.

A Wizard tormented by Silk Eyeballs created it long ago. To break the curse of the Ring, you should sacrifice 5 Silk Eyeballs. It doesn't have to be Morien.

So our villagers raise boar and deer. But at their hearts they're still wild animals, so if we manage them poorly, they turn fierce. Garot, over by the Tomb of the Dead, is good example. He was smart. One day he broke the fence and escaped, forming a group with other boars. Our village has invested a lot in raising Garot, so we can't just let our investment go. We need the money. I heard if we can defeat Chief Garot, then the other boars will naturally just return to their home. That's exactly what you have to do. Defeat Chief Garot at the Graves of the Dead and bring back Garot's Tooth. We are hoping that the other boars will return if they see Chief Garot's Tooth in our possession.	This is a broad plan, and it feels bad sacrificing a Garot. But if we can gain much by losing one Garot, then it's a worthwhile sacrifice. Defeat the Chief Garot at the Tomb of the Dead and bring back the Garot's Tooth.	Good job! With the tooth you brought back, the hunters can hunt down the Boars.

If you're going to stand there like that and not move on, I will have to ask someone else to do the quest. So, last chance.

Go to Bura northeast inside the village.	If the fire was made by an ordinary person, water would have been enough to extinguish it. But a fire created by the power of magic can only be extinguished with the power of magic. There are many ways, but in cases like these, we always turn to Bura for help.

I need Ice Flowers, which grow in the plains near Golundo although there is a problem with that. The Ice Flowers grow near the Groont Peninsula, where Viper Warriors live. They really like Ice Flowers, so they will undoubtedly fight tooth and nail to protect them. So if you could defeat ten Viper Warriors for me I can quickly grab the Ice Flowers.	Without the Ice Flower, there can be no alchemy. We can't extinguish the fire, either. Do you understand me? Hurry up and defeat ten Viper Warriors near the Groont Peninsula.

Now we have to make him pay for this. He has something called the Water Jewel, which he keeps hidden out in the rocks. It allows him to summon awesome power even in places where no water exists, as long as he possesses the jewel. If he loses the Water Jewel, his power will diminish immediately. He will learn his lesson if you can find me the Water Jewel among the rocks south of Balbre Hill.	It's our only chance. He'll have no power if you get me the Water Jewel from among the rocks south of Balbre Hill.	The revenge is complete. Do I want to destroy him? I have no interest in doing that.

He's concerned Golundo isn't more influential in the region. The King, like our ancestors, is always worried about small local tribes getting too defiant.  So naturally he was furious when Goblin Chief Ciroro started showing up right near Golundo. We need a plan to defeat Ciroro. A frontal attack on his people will never work. But one on one we have a chance. We should start by defeating Bashiva, Ciroro's right-hand man. Bashiva lives near Kandia Mine.	Even seemingly weak and useless Goblins can become threats if they gather in large numbers. So they are the ones we need to look out for most around this area. Defeat Goblin Scout Bashiva near Kandia Mine.	Good job!

At night I've become overly sensitive, constantly opening my eyes with even the slightest sound. And when I have fallen asleep if only for a brief moment, I've suffered from awful nightmares. This is killing me. I also have a cold and it's getting worse. I'm trying to find the cause since it seems many others are also suffering from the same thing. I heard from Magic Weapons Merchant Charlize that if I can get the Comfort Talisman, I will be able to sleep soundly again. I think I can get it if you can help me out. Goblin Rangers have the Comfort Talisman, so defeat the Goblin Rangers at the Bala Plain and bring me the Comfort Talisman.	I think they might be suffering from the same thing as us. Insomnia due to some mysterious cause. Or why would such simple-minded Goblins need such a talisman? Go to the Bala Plains, defeat the Goblin Rangers and get the Comfort Talisman.	Oh, good job!

When he opened the chest, he couldn't get to sleep and even if he did, he always had nightmares. The same thing. So it's a good idea to ask him. Go to Archer Trainer Callisto just south of the village.	It might be worth listening to his story, seriously. Go and ask Archer Trainer Callisto, just south of the village.	You want to hear the story about the box? I always wander and go hunting whenever I have time. One day, I found a box in the gap between rocks in Algema Basin! I looked good, so I took it.

If you find the Traveler's Ashes, everything will be resolved. I heard the chest was found near the Algema Basin, so that's probably where the traveler died. Look among the rocks near the Algema Basin. If you find the Traveler's Ashes, collect them carefully and bring them back to me.	I don't mind consoling the deceased because I'm alive.

They use a Crawler named Slum. Although it circulates randomly through the tribes, it actually contains valuable information. We need to defeat it to prevent this exchange of information. The tactic is to pressure the enemy psychologically. Defeat the Crawler Slum near Crowcross.	If messages are conveyed via a bug, then we will have no chance of finding out what information has been transferred.

People come here from all around to enjoy the festival, so I'm usually quite busy selling things today. Oh, I've been wasting your time. Please go to Elder Brusoto in the center of the village.

After a fierce battle lasting seven days, the dragon finally fell, but not before taking many lives. The opening ceremony of the ice festival commemorates their deaths. Obviously there is no way  we can get the Ice Dragon to come back, nor would we want it to. But in remembrance, we use a Whitedran to symbolize the dragon. I have released one near Solcid Stone House with a Red Magic Jewel on it using magic. Each participant should try to find and defeat the Whitedran. You should try as well, and retrieve the Red Magic Jewel. Go and start your quest!	Defeating the Whitedran is not difficult. It's certainly nothing compared to what our ancestors fought. So don't hesitate. Go and defeat the Whitedran near Solcid Stone House and retrieve the Red Magic Jewel.	This is it, the Red Magic Jewel.

You should follow in their footsteps. Go to the Southern Temple and bow at the temple. Then bring back the Box of Sacrifices.	You should not disrespect our ancestors' traditions. Hurry and go to the Southern Temple and bow. Then bring back the Box of Sacrifices.	The box symbolizes the Elemental's Revelation. Like the Revelation, no one knows what's in the box.

It will become more difficult if he gathers more soldiers, so I think now is the best time to face him. Go to the Bala Plains and defeat the Goblin Chief Ciroro.	He will not be defeated easily, but you can do it! Go to the Bala Plain and defeat the Goblin Chief Ciroro.	You've made it! Your ability is amazing!

We're completely lost, though, because we can't give it to him. We're just too afraid of his wrath. So can you do us a favor? Since we can't ask the Commander for help, we are thinking of going to Guild Leader Lagran. He'll accept my terms if we include three pieces of Broiled Meat of Trenscendence. He absolutely loves broiled meat! You have to go get these three pieces of meat somehow and give them to Guild Leader Lagran east of the city.	We are really desperate. What if Commander Burke knows about this? So please give three pieces of Broiled Meat of Transcendence to Guild Leader Lagran east of the city.	Wow!

What lies within is unknown, so that makes it very intriguing. But Maxo is a smart fellow and keeps the chest far from his home. His own subordinates may be after it, too. He hid the chest underneath the Relics of Battna Site. You need tremendous courage to go near the Ruins. But I bet you qualify for the job. Get the chest back.	What are you doing?

Defeat the Thief Soldier Maxo near Dadhal. And once you're done, go to Mercenary Bobum and ask about the results.	The longer you delay, the more severe the mercenaries' pain becomes. Commander Burke will get angry, too. Come on... Defeat the Thief Soldier Maxo near Dadhal.  And once you're done, go to Mercenary Bobum and ask about the results.	Thank you. You saved our lives.

Very slowly, as if waking from a deep sleep. He'll be fully awake very soon. That is the moment we're waiting for. Preparations are already under way deep inside the cave.</n>However, Barva seems to anxiously wait for the devil's revival. Probably because once the devil starts to move, the number of undead will increase dramatically.

You already know there are Spriggans near Trilgard. They belong to groups led by Shuta and Jimbo. Jimbo's pack has been living in the area a long time. Shuta's horde recently came from the other side of the Terratoga Mountains. The clash between these two had some unexpected consequences. Shuta's horde occupied the Temple of Time to get the legendary weapon 'Gasz.' It's very difficult to get rid of them as they guard their lives with magic. It's been months since it happened. We've kept this secret from the King, but it's just a matter of time until he finds out. We had to take care of this by ourselves, and that's why we needed the Armor.

Go <HFFFA7272>around Grey Valley<HFFFFFFFF> and get rid of <HFFFA7272>25 Spriggan Warriors<HFFFFFFFF>. Of course I will deliver the Scroll to <HFFFA7272>Guard Poah<HFFFFFFFF> <HFFFA7272>in front of the Southern gate of the City<HFFFFFFFF>.	Is it too much?

Don't worry and just go to him after hunting because I will give the Scroll to <HFFFA7272>Guard Poah<HFFFFFFFF> <HFFFA7272>in front of the Southern gate of the City<HFFFFFFFF> as soon as I get it.

We were talking about who's better as a trainer, and this Archer Trainer Gorgan said warriors were too stupid to develop fully. You know what I did? I challenged him and we made a bet. If I succeed in finding something he hides, he says he will never underestimate warriors again. All I have to do is simply find the thing and prove my senses are as good as an archers. The problem is, I'm supposed to find it, but I can't leave right now. I have a bad hangover, so I need your help. Gorgan said he hid a Water Bottle beneath a rock near Elements Waterfall. As soon as you locate that Bottle, go to the Archer Trainer Gorgan south of Trilgard Square.	This is a really important bet, a duel. It would be a piece of cake if I wasn't feeling so sick. Then I wouldn't be asking you for anything. But please, as soon as you find the Water Bottle hidden beneath the rock near Elements Waterfall, go to Archer Trainer Gorgan, south of Trilgard Square.	Hmm, this is the Water Bottle. Why did you bring it here? Oh, Kildemor told you to bring it to me. That sounds suspicious... Well, I'll take it anyway, but I'll definitely laugh if I find out Kildemor wasn't the one who found it. But that's not the problem right now. There's something more important. Wait for a second.																				178783231	1595	Water Bottle	1																	1. Find the Water Bottle on the rock near Elements Waterfall.	6	2.

So we bet on something.</n>We promised to hunt Spriggan Warriors until now and collect <HFFFA7272>6 Bells<HFFFFFFFF> as evidence, but my Bow was cut into two pieces last night. Sorry, but I want you to do this for me. Of course you shouldn't tell this to Lytillo. You can get them around here by killing Spriggan Warriors in Grey Valley and using your <HFFFA7272>Collecting Skill<HFFFFFFFF>. When you get them, go to <HFFFA7272>Magic Trainer Lytillo<HFFFFFFFF> in the <HFFFA7272>North part of the City<HFFFFFFFF> to show them.	It's not foul play. There are no other options. So hunt Spriggan Warriors in Grey Valley and use your <HFFFA7272>Collecting Skill<HFFFFFFFF> to get <HFFFA7272>6 Bells<HFFFFFFFF>. Then, go to <HFFFA7272>Magic Trainer Lytillo<HFFFFFFFF> in the <HFFFA7272>North part of the City<HFFFFFFFF> and show them to him.	You came here instead of Gorgan? Hm. He must have been very upset.

Warrior Trainer Kildemor said Wizards know but little of the world, so they can't find precious items hidden in a dead body. Clearly, it.</n>So I promised to hunt Monsters and get the items he told me by this time today, but an urgent situation prevented me from completing it.</n>So I want you to handle this.

And Spriggans were Gnomes originally. In fact, I never knew they would misuse the information like that. It's not really my fault! Doesn't that make sense? Well I guess I provided the fundamental cause. So let me tell you something to make up for my mistake. The origin of the magic the Spriggans cast in the Temple of Time is an ancient magic. You can find out what it is from the Scroll at Baran Dyke Fortress Two. Find the Scroll and give it to Mayor Prosto east of the city, but tell him nothing about me.	You know it's not a good idea to waste time here. Hurry up. Find the Scroll at the Barandyke Fortress Two and give the Scroll to Mayor Prosto east of the city.	What is this? Oh, I see.

Deliver my message to Mayor Prosto, east of Trilgard Square.	You haven't left yet. You still don't believe me, but he will. Just tell Mayor Prosto east of Trilgard Square what I said.	Well done. What happened? Hmm. Well, who knows what will happen, but I trust Aliti. He'll take care of everything along the way, and at least that person with the Herb won't just cheat us.

Recently, I got back at them a little with the help of some Shamans. Now they're just going crazy and popping up everywhere I go, harassing me. The damage is substantial. If I attack them again, I'll have to pay for it. I know better than that. You think I'm an idiot? So, I want you to hunt them down for me. The worst of them are east of the Red Stone Road. I want you to kill twenty of them.	Apparently, you don't want to help me. Are you ignoring my request? If not, you'd better hurry up. Kill twenty Ghost Thieves east of the Red Stone Road.

Go to Magic Trainer Telecaster southeast of the village, and tell him about my situation.	Koop's been cursed? The rash you talked about is called the Curse of the Dead. It's not from living beings.

Koop isn't a fan of humans, to say the least. That's why he hates Ghost Thieves. However, the Ghost Thieves of Silancium have their own story, too.</n>They were humans who died in the monster war about six months ago. Those Humans came here through a Portal. Some of them returned home through the Portal, but some missed their chance and they were driven back to Silancium, where they were slaughtered. Because of that, they're deeply resentful toward Orcs and Koop just fans the flames.</n>Anyway, if that's the case, we need to find a solution. Let's figure out a way to soothe their souls. Bring me <HFFFA7272>11 Scales<HFFFFFFFF>. You can get them by using your <HFFFA7272>Collecting Skill<HFFFFFFFF> on <HFFFA7272>Dark Wyverns<HFFFFFFFF> near <HFFFA7272>Dusty Creek<HFFFFFFFF>.

But Security Chief Koop doesn't really care about security, rather he encourages the mercenaries to do bad things. My safe is not protected from the mercenaries either, but I don't know what to do. I recently lost my Gold Nugget. I may need to negotiate with them. Can you go to Mercenary Scar at the north gate of the village and talk to him about my offer?	This is urgent. Hurry to Mercenary Scar at the north gate of the village and talk to him about this matter.

I didn't think much about it at that time, but now that I heard Koop met MoonElf envoys,  I remembered my friend said those bodies were dressed in MoonElves' official uniforms. But these so-called envoys never asked any questions about the dead ones. So I did a little bit of investigating myself, and I saw them talking to some unknown Orcs more than once. What I'm saying is that they may not be real MoonElf envoys. If those bodies were proven to be the real MoonElf envoys, Koop might have second thoughts, right? The evidence is buried in Silancium. MoonElf envoys always carry Karafel's Imperial Sword and Belange's Document with them. My colleague must have buried them together with the bodies. You'll be able to find them under a rock north of the Wind Plains. When you find them, give them to Security Chief Koop at the west gate of the village and tell him what I said.

In fact, I am the one who told them about Travel Rations in the first place.</n>They don't understand the danger they face and they definitely don't know anything about monsters. Now they have gotten themselves into trouble by attacking some monsters they shouldn't have. Some of them were surrounded. </n>It's typical for travelers but I can't just ignore their predicament.

So, go to <HFFFA7272>Dusty Creek<HFFFFFFFF> and kill <HFFFA7272>25 Mobet Largewings<HFFFFFFFF>.	They were lucky. They're all injured pretty badly, but none of them died.

Even if they can't get back the rest of their items, they need their Money Pouch. You're a fellow traveler, so you do understand, right? Think about it. What if all the items in your inventory and all the Gold in your possession just disappeared... Now, you know what I'm talking about? So, please do this for them.

Please destroy Dreadwolves west of Dusty Creek and retrieve the Money Pouch.	Oh, the Money Pouch. Great. Now they can continue to travel. Worst case scenario, they might have ended up as Koop's slaves for the rest of their lives. They drank and ate quite a bit on credit so far. I guess they haven't been through hard times before.

When I saw how unprepared they were, I gave them some advice and found out they had a story. One of their good friends went on a journey to Silancium and died there. Now they're here trying to recover his remains if possible. I know they're reckless, but the reason is rather moving, isn't it? So I said we would recover the traveler's Ashes for them. Yes, I know. I didn't have a plan. But I knew you could do it. Please recover the Traveler's Ashes from a rock in the Dusty Creek.	The friendship and loyalty of these young people really makes me cry. It's beautiful, isn't' it? So, you've got try hard. Please recover the traveler's Ashes from a rock in the Dusty Creek.	Now the dead man will be back with his friends.

I recently purchased Golden Arrows from a merchant who came from the West. They're not made of pure gold, but inside the shaft, some magical gold ensures that these Arrows always strike their target. It's very useful in emergencies.</n>But some thief-like Harpies stole them from me. I'm so mad, but that won't get my Arrows back. Now I must use my hunting and tracking abilities. I will follow their trail. It's fairly urgent. If they get too far away, it will be hopeless. So, get me <HFFFA7272>2 Hindseeker Armpads<HFFFFFFFF>. Mine are too old to be of any use. Do me this favor.	Just about the only Orc Armor our race of Satyros can wear is the Armpads. Come on, get me <HFFFA7272>2 Hindseeker Armpads<HFFFFFFFF>.	Hey, you're late!

It could be in the branch of a <HFFFA7272>Tree<HFFFFFFFF> or in the Crack of a Rock. I don't know what kind of trail he left. He slipped on a <HFFFA7272>Bloody Feather<HFFFFFFFF> here, and you might be lucky enough to find more. OK. Let's each pick up the trail and chase the thief.	Well, I haven't left yet, but what about you? This isn't good... We'd better hurry. Go search among the tree branches or under rocks in Dusty Creek for proof, like a Bloody Feather.	Hmm... My guess was right... This feather is just like the other one... Nothing in the North, so he must be going South. Let's think about his position...

I don't care about Dark Sentios at all. So, I need help from Telecaster this time. He would be better... no, he knows more about magic. So, take Dark Sentio's Record to Magic Trainer Telecaster southeast of the village.	This is a big favor from me, so you have to let him know about it. Take Dark Sentio's Record to Magic Trainer Castor southeast of the village.	A completely unexpected guest! And unexpected gifts, too! Oh, of course I know about the book. I know more about this book than anyone in the village. And about recent events, too. I was actualy nervous that Koop might do something rash, but he dealt with it wisely. Give me the book.

Maybe they were trying to get Dark Sentio's Record. I had it with me. I heard the MoonElves first lost the book after being attacked by monsters. There's something going on... The necklaces the monsters had on really concern me. I am sure those are... I really need your help. I'll start the ceremony to bring out the Dark Hall, but I'm worried about monsters.

The Mist Slasher symbolizes revenge to Orcs in the southern area. They give this as a token of revenge. Well, Castor isn't an Orc, but I'm sure he gave it to me with that intention. He would never just give me a present. How should I pay him back? Right... I'll give him a curse that is most fitting. You'll find a tombstone lying underneath a small pond north of Wind Plain. A Cursed Ring is hidden under the tombstone. Deliver the Cursed Ring to Magic Trainer Castor southeast of the village.	I know the ring exists, but I don't know the story behind it. You should find someone else to tell you about it. Please don't bother me anymore. Just get the Cursed Ring beneath a tombstone north of the Wind Plain and deliver it to Magic Trainer Castor southeast of the village.	This is what is known as a Ring of Curse, but that name is somewhat misleading. The tombstone commemorated a former Thief King in that region. Although he was a thief, he was a champion for the less fortunate and weak. After his death, his body was cremated and his followers buried his ring, placing a tombstone above it. When the great troops of Orcs swept across that area, they all protected that Tombstone with their lives.																				165609585	2615	Ring of Curse	1																	1.

He has great strength for sure, but is somewhat afraid of magic. This Cursed Ring seems to be a symbol of his nervousness about me. I'll make use of his fear.

Because there's a legend about them just like the one about the Thief King. Actually a Ghost Thief's Talisman just soothes the minds of those who leave their homes. But some travelers think they're cursed. So get the Ghost Thief's Talisman north of Dusty creek and give it to Security Chief Koop in front of the west gate of the village, telling him where it came from.	What is this talisman? What?

They want the hide of a monster. That's all they told me. They're probably afraid I might intercept it if they told me too much. They just told me that it's hidden somewhere in the display rack in Redderhood in Membreathen. Maybe the hunters left it when Spriggans raided the area. So, go get the Monster's Hide.	There's no other way you can trade with them. They're really picky, but sometimes even general merchants have to deal with them because they have goods others don't. Get the Monster's Hide in the display rack in Redderhood in Membreathen.	They look just like other skins, but there must be a reason they want it so badly. We Merchants should be well-informed.

A friend of mine is imprisoned in an underground cave on false charges of stealing Security Chief Koop's stuff. I can't do anything while my best friend is there. I visited him for a really short time and heard something from him. He told me that the one who falsely accused him has a document in his wagon. The document says the false accusation was for revenge. With that document, we can do something about all this, but I can't go anywhere because he might be executed. So, I want you to help me. Get the Document of Vengeance my friend told me about from a wagon in Wasteland.	The accuser sent a document to take Vengeance against my friend. How vile he is! My friend was arrested by Koop after receiving that letter. What can I say? Preposterous. Anyway, my friend's life is at stake.

He was in prison too long and has no strength to fight the monsters. I'll distract Koop's mercenaries and you destroy twenty-five Fountain Lamias west of Dusty creek to open the way for my friend.

Koop threatened to kill me by noon tomorrow unless I bring back his stuff. I'm so sorry, but you have to help me one more time. He metamorphosed into a Marylith Sailor and ran west of the Wind Plains. I don't know which one is my friend, but you have to retrieve the Gold Nugget he took from Koop.

Well, even if you're not, you have to be a thief this time to help Shakran. The ideal metal is Illuminite, harder than cast iron, but as light as a feather and as flexible as a willow branch. Only Gnomes know how to handle it, and there is only a little Illuminite around. You have to steal it from the wagon of a Gnome keeper in the Sealed Mine. And if you get caught, don't tell anyone I put you up to this.	Sometimes stealing others' things is inevitable. Come on, get Illuminite from the carriage wagon in the Sealed Mine.	Good.

I saw someone drop something into a box around General Merchant Kuro's store at the village center and then just disappear. It was weird. One would normally pick it up, but he was in a big hurry and just left. Thinking back, I guess he might have been the thief. I don't know exactly what he dropped, but it looked like a Dagger at a glance. If you happen to find it there, take it to Item Trader Seena east of the village.	This is all I know, so get out of here. Just go get the Dagger in a box near General Merchant Kuro's store in the village center and take it to Item Trader Seena east of the village.	Oh...

Many travelers don't like to work with him. It's a surprise that you didn't know that as you are a traveler yourself. But I don't want to be rejecting an entrant without a good reason. So, let's just do it like this. I once found the Rigid Chest at some ruins with some travelers. We tried our best to open it but we all failed. On top of that, it was too heavy to move, so we just left it there. The location is the well southwest of the Blood Shelter and the chest is inside the well. Deliver that Rigid Chest to traveler Kaneiosis south of Zylok and tell him he'll be accepted if he opens it.	I know this is rather mean, but if Kaneios is as they say, he should fall for it.

With our unique traditional way, I think I have one chance to recreate the axe. But I need a Crystal of Blaze, which is extremely hard to get. At least in Ezerock and Grimlore. So, it looks like you'll have to go a long way to get it. If you go to the Limelight area, west of the place where the Humans live, there is a place called Gnome's Cave. Go there and you will meet Miner Picken Firepick. He might be able to supply it.	It's going to be a really long journey, so there's no time to waste. Go to Miner Pikin Firepick at the Gnome Cave in the Limelight area and ask about the Crystal of Blaze.	You've come all the way here and I have nothing to serve to you. Please accept my apologies. Tell me, how is Balo... no, Falcon doing? We haven't corresponded for so long. By the way, why are you here? Crystal of Blaze! oh.... Is that what he's looking for? Yeah, it's a Fire Elemental Stone that's been buried underground for a long time. It soaks up the power of the Land Elemental for so long it can't be used as a proper Elemental Stone, but it produces flames forever, so it's very useful for anything needing to be processed in fire for a long time.

He is 'Rophacham,' also known as the 'Star of the Wilderness.' He was known for his brilliant charisma. He wasn't a follower of Ugdrasil but he fought in the Hundred Days War leading a group of independent soldiers. He was killed by Zian Manas's soldiers there.</n>But, according to some new information, there is a rumor that Rophacham is living among the hordes of humans west of <HFFFA7272>Shinewood<HFFFFFFFF>. I am here as the Security Chief, and I cannot see others resorting to a man of the past. I want you to go there and discover the truth. Their Elder must know about the rumor.

I may have been alive a long time, but I'm not quite 100 yet. There is no way I could know anything about Rophacham. However, I once heard there's an Orc Soldier buried somewhere in the forest.</n>But I'm not sure where it is. I will try to find out but I will need your help.

Although I wasn't educated that well, I can at least make sense of it. Basically it says, I am already dead and buried; Anyone who wants to find my memory, get it from the wooden barricade. It's quite cryptic, but I think the wooden barricade refers to the Gateway near the Dragon Inn site. That Gateway was blocked off over a hundred years ago. You might find the Log if you go through the wooden barricade of the Gateway.	Actually, I'm not sure if it will be there, but you should set off. Don't just stand there like that. Look through the wooden barricade of the Gateway near the Dragon Inn and find the Log there.	This is the Log. Let me see what it says. Ah. Hmm... This is an Elemental Letter. It's ancient.

This log is more than enough to learn about Lofacham. But Koop said he didn't like the idea of Lofacham's existence, right? So, if he gets this log, he'll probably destroy it. Listen, we should keep this for future generations. Here's a plan. I'll give you this Jewel Box. It's priceless and Koop will love it. Just say the rumors were false and you found this instead. He'll fall for it. Deliver the Box to Security Chief Koop in front of the west gate of Zylok.	This is the most expensive thing I own, but it's nothing compared to the Log. The most valuable treasure is one our descendents can study. So deliver the Box to Security Chief Koop in front of the west gate of Zylok and say the rumors were false.	Oh! What's this Jewel Box?

My sister left for Windrill over a month ago to be an item dealer like me, but hasn't yet sent a Carrier Pigeon's Letter to say she's alright. I'm really anxious. So, I want to know where and how she is. If you go to the Ghost Valley, you'll find a carriage. A sorcerer used to live in the carriage in the past but it's now abandoned.

My eyesight blurred for a moment, and now I can see what was once invisible. And furthermore, I feel like I can see all that's true. My sister is imprisoned in an underground cave. It's a magical trap set a long time ago for someone else, and my own sister is now trapped there, barely surviving. I have to break the spell. The cave is in Shinewood, a place made with the power of elementals. I need three things to save my sister, but the best solution will come from someone who knows that area best. Go to Ellore. There you can find Item Trader Dolly whom I met at the Association of Item Traders. Take him two Water Necklaces because I'll be asking him a difficult favor.	I really care about my family, so please hurry. Go to Item Trader Dolly of Ellore in Shinewood and bring her two Water Necklaces.	Wow... These are Water Necklaces. They're so gorgeous and really valuable in Shinewood because it's so close to water. These are for me? I bet there must be a reason. So, what do you want from me? Wow... That's quite difficult... Although we're not that close geographically, we're friends because of our activities at the association. But, an underground cave in Shinewood? I've never heard of it. I think the Elder would probably know about it, but a stranger like you can't ask him, right?

There actually is a cave underneath Shinewood. Well, technically, it's not a cave but a series of caverns created by the roots of the Le Sidul at the center of town.

I wouldn't want to do it again, but it was worth it. I found out where the entrance to the cave might be. I made a rubbed copy of the place, so we can have a more careful look. Heh...

And there's also some information about the three seals. One of them belongs to a Monster, Thunder Griffin Bleege, who lives near the Dragon Inn.

Yet, I have no idea where it was. So, I want you to find that mark for me. I'm not even sure which direction it is, but my guess is, it's likely to be in the Dead Cliff. To be honest with you, I've been virtually everywhere and found nothing, so I'm in despair and in no mood to do anything. So, I hope you can do this for me. Search the trees in the Dead Cliff and bring the Visible Mark that you find.	It's not that I'm lazy. I'm just sick and tired of looking for the mark. I'm exhausted and asking you for a favor.

Don't give me that look. I was presented with a riddle by Shocker! What was the riddle? This is what he said, It brings death during sleep, but is the friend of deer when awake. What is it?  You don't know, do you? Oh dear. I guess I'll have to get someone else's help. Warrior Armor Merchant Peabay, on the north of the village, is great with riddles. He might know the answer.  Hurry and go ask him.	Warrior Armor Merchant Peabay, who's north of the village, is good at riddles. Go ask him.	Riddles?  I do love them.  What's the riddle?

It uses its toxic gas to kill all animals that approach it at night. But during the day, it's simply a plant that deer like to eat. Pretty easy for those of us who like riddles.  Anyway, Deathnote didn't know it. Well, I also heard that Shocker only accepts the answer if the actual item is brought to him. So you will have to find Sandragora. You can find it among the roots of shrubs near Glitters at the West end of Silancium. Find the Sandragora and take it to Alchemist Deathnote at the center of the village.	This means we have solved the puzzle, not Deathnote. But... Well anyway, find Sandragora among the shrub roots near Glitters.  Then take it to Alchemist Deathnote at the center of the village.	Sandragora! That's what it was. That may have been easy for Peabay, but it was a hard question for me.

In order to calm the mercenaries down again, they'll want Barrakas' friend dead, but then all your efforts would go to waste, so I've been acting as a mediator. To mercenaries, weapons are like their own children, but when Zarkas died, his weapon disappeared as well. He was killed by Robatoms in the Death Plains. Get Zarkas' Sword from them.

I don't know who their leader is, but I hear the monsters are following a strategy just like trained soldiers. The mercenaries are scared of them. Recently, Trilgard's nobleman Turgarb lost an Albileon to monsters in the process of importing it from MoonElves. He's put out a big reward for the one who finds his Albileon, but no one has stepped foward, yet, because the monsters are so ferocious. I personally know Turgarb, so I can't ignore his pain. Isn't this what you've been training yourself for? Yes, that's the spirit. Anything is possible! So go to the Nobleman Turgarb near the South gate of Trilgard and find out about this incident.  Good luck!	I hope we're not causing more trouble by butting into other people's business. Well, you've offered to help. So go to the Nobleman Trugarb at the south gate near Trilgard.

A long time ago, the King of Samlan, who had control over Silancium, built a Big Statue to symbolize his power.

Tantlas' Belt is truly legendary. Based on the records, we know it shows different elements in different seasons based on Alchemic principles. It would be an exciting discovery if that Leather Fragment is genuinely from the Belt. Can you ask him to show it to me? If you go empty handed, he will not hear you, so take <HFFFA7272>3 Wurt Zweihanders<HFFFFFFFF> with you. He will like those because he collects weapons. Of course you should also ask him to give me the Leather.	It's not enough but there is no choice.

He says he wants to take care of the recent conflict among monsters in Silancium and has requested my help.  But as an Orc and as a security chief, I can't do that. I actually want to interfere with the Humans' operations, but I want to do it covertly and plan to order the Guild Registrars to have the Guilds help me. Go to Guild Registrar Jean Kiev in the center of the village and tell him my wishes.	Well, I suspect Jean Kiev won't comply with my wishes easily, but go to Guild Registrar Jean Kiev in the center of the village and tell him my intentions anyway.	What's Koop up to?

I'll handle Koop, so let's go on with what we had in mind. I heard Skita helped the Humans this time. It might be a good idea to give him more evidence, making Humans more willing to battle the monsters. I hear the Ancient Relics of the Salam Empire are involved in this incident. I think it's important to retrieve all of them. According to what I heard, the Redflag Raiders on the Hawks' Plateau carry around items called the Crest of the Salam Empire. Whenever the Salam Empire went to war, they used this magical crest on their flags. It's supposed to make anyone standing under it fearless. I'm sure the monsters don't know about this, but it's still dangerous for them to remain in their hands. So, please find the five Crests they're carrying around and deliver them to Warrior Weapons Merchant Skita north of the village!	Don't be lazy. Get moving! Go to the Hawks' Plateau and find the five Crests of the Salam Empire. The Redflag Raiders have them. Then go to Warrior Weapons Merchant Skita north of the village!	Oh, my. I was actually wondering what to do after hearing about the Crests. Thank you. But how did you know to bring these to me? That's just like Jean Kiev. I think it would be in everyone's best interest to do so. I have another favor to ask, so don't leave.

I sent some of my mercenaries to take care of the monsters, but they got in over their heads. To make things worse, most of my forces have gone to Kuhn because of the recent incident there, so I can't send any backup... except you.

He called it the 'Beggar's Curse.' Anyway, that's what happened. He said I would get in trouble if I told anyone about it before he finished his 'task' and I believe him. What task? I don't know. That's all I saw. Well, now I've told you everything, you've got to help me. Go to Magic Trainer Telecaster, southeast of the village, and see what he can do.	I fear I may have told you too much.

They started coming after 'that day.'  I don't know if headaches are also considered a disease, but once they start, they last for hours. I don't tell such things to other people, but I think I can trust you. A few years ago, I was kidnapped during my travels. I don't remember who kidnapped me or for what reason. I only remember an obscure image as if someone erased my memory. Maybe I know something they don't want revealed. I also lost a bag at that time. Recently, Kaneios said he got a small bag in Silancium. I'm thinking it might be mine. I want to get it back, but he's asking an outrageous price for it. I'm sorry, but I'd like you to act as a mediator. Go to Traveler Kaneios south of the village, and talk to him.	He's known to be a very impatient and rough traveler. Not a pleasant fellow, but I'm in an urgent situation so go to Traveler Kaneios south of the village, and tell him my story.	So Felicia sent you, eh? Hmm, she's always thought little of me. So there's no reason I should help or cooperate, is there? So that's that.																																								1.

Ah, I can remember why I was kidnapped and who kidnapped me. They must have been Dark Sentio's followers. They tried to steal the Document from me. I was afraid of that and I made a copy. This is written with Dark Characters so I can't read it now, but I would have known how to read it at that time. Maybe the followers erased everything. I will certainly learn how to read them again and regain my lost memories. I'll bring back what I saw and heard when I was kidnapped. If the opportunity comes to me, would you please help me?

Do you know about him? He was one of the greatest mercenaries ever. His whereabouts haven't been known since the last battle with the Golems. At least now we know he's dead. I recognize this scar on his head. Did you find his axe near his ashes? I'm talking about 'Leinwurt.' It was reknowned for its ability to split anything. You know, a mercenary values his weapon as much as himself. There's even a saying, to truly honor a dead mercenary, have a funeral for his weapon. We have to find 'Leinwurt' to pay our respects to this fine mercenary. The only clue we have would be these ashes. Take them to Magic Trainer Telecaster, southeast of the village, and ask him what he can learn about the Axe.	If Security Chief Koop knows about it, he won't like it. Magic Trainer Telecastor, just southeast of the village, is the only sorcerer we can trust. Take these Ashes to him and ask him where the Axe is.	Recently, I've heard of people finding the ashes of mercenaries all around the village. Thank you for bringing them to me. What can I do to help you?

I suspect that Skita has already talked to Peabay so everything will be easier than we thought now. Find two MoonElves' Studded Leather Cuirasses and give them to the Warrior Armor Merchant Peabay, just north of the village. He will like them because he has lots of interest in other tribe's armor.	I will say it again, please listen carefully. The two Studded Leather Cuirasses are MoonElves'. Don't forget that. You also must remember that they go to Warrior Armor Merchant Peabay north of the village.	Hmm... I can't say that... Oh, isn't this MoonElves' armor? You've given me such a valuable gift, so I need to give you something in return... Um...  I already heard from Skita. You were the one who brought them into line. It's not easy to mobilize my men all together. I'm not even sure it's worth the trouble most of the time. If necessary however, I'll help.

Although she didn't belong to the mercenaries, she supported us from the shadows when Skita and Peabay were fighting as a pair. If she joins us, we'll definitely be an elite fighting force. The problem is that she won't easily accept our offer. As I told you, since she wasn't a mercenary, she won't listen to me, but that doesn't mean she's impossible to reason with... A few days ago, a MoonElf named Grahams died in the Lufut Land, but her crossbow hasn't been retrieved yet. In reality,  I hid it amongst the rocks in the Lufut Land to prevent it being found. I knew I could use it later. Maybe the crossbow will be enough to motivate Shakran. Find Grahams' Crossbow and deliver it to the Archer Weapons Merchant Shakran north of the village.	Of course, Shakran is different from Skita and Peabay, so she may not accept our offer so readily. Find Grahams' Crossbow amongst the rocks in Lufut Land. Then go to the Archer Weapons Merchant Shakran, just north of the village and give the Crossbow to her.	Oh, I know why you're here. I've already heard from Peabay. You brought that Crossbow to win me over, right? Hmm. MoonElves' bows make nice ornaments, but there's one thing Scar doesn't realize about me. No one can make a bow better than myself.

Don't treat me like Peabay or Skita. I'm much more clever than they are. What made them think I would help thieves? As you can see, my answer is no. But don't worry too much. The men I sent while you were on your way here have probably made it to Skita and Koop. Peabay and I have not only opposed the battle but also pledged to defeat Redflag. I'm sure Skita and Koop are deeply offended right now. Ha! Ha! You may still get involved in this, but you need to face up to reality. I'll help you realize it for yourself. I heard that the Redflag Bandits got some neighboring monsters to help fight as soon as Skita raids. If the bandits and monsters attack from behind, Skita's troops will run into trouble. Go east of the Wanderer Plains and destroy thirty Trancorpse Sins, rendering their strategy useless.	You have to hurry. Save Skita and Peabay from a crisis by destroying thirty Trancorpse Sins east of the Wanderer Plains.	What a relief! The Redflags will be running scared.

Alchemists back in the Age of Chaos created a monster named Mastook to guard against anyone becoming Archlord. Mastook was very violent and was drawn to anyone who possessed an Archon. Finally the monster was destroyed, but his eye survived. It has amazing powers of clairvoyance. I've heard the eye is somewhere in Silancium, but Mormorine is refusing to lend me the book that might explain where it is exactly. So what I'd like you to do is steal the book. I've heard Mormorine is so worried about me taking the book he's hidden it in a jar in front of his house. He'd never suspect you. Bring me the Fables of Chaos, a book hidden in a jar in front of Mormorine's house north of Trilgard.	I'm asking for a favor.

However, Mastook's Eye can't be retrieved simply by killing the Metal Golems anytime. It can only be retrieved while the spell written in this book is active. Could you destroy Metal Golems for me? But first, let me cast a spell... Okay, it's done. I hope it works. Destroy the Metal Golems in the Wanderer Plain and find  Mastook's Eye.	Move before the power of the spell dissipates. Destroy the Metal Golems in the Wanderer Plains and retrieve Mastook's Eye.	Hey! This is Mastook's Eye. Um... I think we can find Lawrence with it... Yes.

If you're right, Juwan probably doesn't know how to use the Eye yet. She may be keeping it in storage. What you need to do is to steal the Eye. Why? Well, you don't know how to use it either. Besides clairvoyance, Mastook's Eye has enormous powers of destruction. There's a story saying as many as ten thousand sorcerers were killed by the power of the Eye while they tried to catch Mastook in the Age of Chaos. The Eye is very dangerous. It can wipe out Zylok in a fraction of a second, but she was so fascinated she wouldn't listen to me. There's not much time. The eye has probably been absorbing the power of souls ever since it came out of the heart of the Metal Golem. Steal the Mastook's Eye from Juwan's storage chest, just west of Zylok.

My enemies are always looking for a chance to drive me out. I'm afraid this incident could work against me. Hmm, I just thought of something I could have you do. Telecaster said the monsters have a wand which will  react with the monster's evil spirits and make the Ghost appear. If the wand is destroyed, the Ghost won't come back.

There is a place for all races to battle. It is called Battle Square and, according to the Elemental Records, it was once a castle once housing an Underground race in ancient times.</n>But now it is known as the worst sort of hell.

You can get there through the Portal next to the east gate.	You did a great job. This is Mikey's Document, but I can't open the seal. On the surface...

Thanks to you I got the Earth Golem Hearts I needed. Yes, I promised to tell you about the contents of the Document. Here's what I've learned so far.... Back when Battle Square was the castle of an underground tribe, the Square was under the control of Michek. However, he got into a disagreement with his colleague Rome, who ended up putting him in prison. Then Rome made the mistake of taking in Sorcerer Basarah to help him. Basarah quickly took over the castle and killed Rome. Michek escaped from prison somehow and fought Basarah, who eventually left the castle and it became Battle Square. That's all for today. I have to take care of other things. Just wait.						758	Earth Golem	5																																1. Kill 5 Earth Golems in Battle Square.	4	2.

He was there to the guard five heroes who followed Mikey. They were detained deep in the dungeon. The five heroes probably have something to do with the Archlord. The rumor that there are people detained in the dungeon has been around for a long time. Maybe the rumor is true. I want to see this in person. Move to the Battle Square by using the Portal next to the east gate. And then, defeat Magmaron in the middle of Battle Square. I'll find out the whereabouts of the heroes. The place is so dangerous. So I suggest you take the proper equipment and go with a few others to help you out.	As he was chosen by Basarah to take care of the dungeon, Magmaron will have strong evil powers. Fortunately however, as he also has a weakness, so we can beat him. After moving to Battle Square through the Portal next to the east gate, defeat Magmaron in the middle of Battle Square. I will find out where the heroes are. The place is so dangerous. You'd better go only after putting together a party with others and making careful preparations.	You took down invincible Magmaron, but I can't find the five heroes. I've only found shackles as evidence they were there. I wonder where they've gone. Of course, as long as Basarah is alive, they probably won't show up. Only when Basarah has fallen will they see a peace. Anyhow, thank you for letting sunshine light the Battle Square.						760	Magmaron	1																																1. Defeat a Magmaron in Battlesquare.	4	2.

Down below, there is a battle field where all tribes can come together.  It's generally known as the Battle Square. The record of the Elementals says the Battle Square was the castle of an underground tribe who lived here in the ancient times, but now it's known as a dungeon. Records of the Battle Square left by Sorcerer Michek are said to be in the body of one of the Flame Bats guarding the dungeon. I've been there several times but the Bats are too strong for me. I think you'll be able to take them on though. Go to the Battle Square, destroy the Flame Bats and get the Mikey's Document from them. You can get there through the Portal next to the east gate of the village. Once you enter, it won't be easy for you to escape, so I suggest you take the proper equipment and go with a few others to help you out.	Sorcerer Michek is nothing but a legendary sorcerer from the underground tribe. He once had control over the castle, but was driven out. Go to Battle Square, destroy the Flame Bat and retrieve Mikey's Document. You can get there through the Portal next to the east gate.	So the legend must be true. This is Mikey's Document, but I can't open the seal. On the surface... My, these are really sophisticated characters of the Elementals. I can barely read them except when the time comes, ... it shall open. Do you know anyone who can read this?

Back when the Battle Square was the castle of the underground tribe, the Square was under the control of Michek. However, he got into a disagreement with his colleague Rome, who ended up putting him in prison. Then Rome made the mistake of taking in Sorcerer Basarah to help him. Basarah quickly took over the castle and killed Rome. Michek petitioned Basarah for his freedom and eventually he was allowed to leave. Since then, the castle turned into the Battle Square.

Basarah left the land that was sought after by all tribes.  But Magmaron, his right-hand man, still remained.  It was his job to protect the five heroes, who followed Mikey, and who were imprisoned in the dungeon. The five heroes probably have something to do with the Archlord.  Rumors that there are people detained in the dungeon have been around a long time.  Maybe the rumor happens to be true. I'd like to see for myself.

So I suggest you take the proper equipment and go with a few others to help you out.	Your fight with Magmaron would be a great painting theme, but I think heroes are more suitable for me. I will paint you in the corner if you come to mind. After moving to Battle Square by using the Portal northeast of the city square, defeat Magmaron in the middle of Battle Square.	Well, you took down invincible Magmaron, but I failed to find the five heroes. I only found shackles as evidence that they were there. Those aren't exciting to paint. I'm very disappointed. I wonder where they've gone. As long as Basarah is alive, they probably won't turn up. If the heroes do show up, I'll paint them something wonderful. Anyhow, you did a great job.

I barely escaped and realized the only thing I could do was try to keep Reckles from escaping while I wrote letters begging my friends to send me a hero who could help. Now I'm begging you. Please defeat Reckles in the Passageway of Death and bring out his Sword. I can only hope the Queen of the Dead hasn't awakened too....	Reckles is in the Passageway of Death in the Asylum.

In fact, I was so happy I forgot to prepare thoroughly before starting my excavation. Deep underground I found a long hall called The Passageway of Death. By the time I realized where I was, I had already disturbed Reckles, the consort to the Queen of the Dead! Legend says he was awake when he was sealed in the tomb with her anciently, swearing he would protect her forever. What a terrible, dark spirit he has become! I barely escaped and realized the only thing I could do was try to keep Reckles from escaping while I wrote letters begging my friends to send me a hero who could help. Now I'm begging you. Please defeat Reckles in the Passageway of Death and bring out his Sword. I can only hope the Queen of the Dead hasn't awakened too....	Reckles is in the Passageway of Death in the Asylum. Bring me Reckles' Sword after taking him down.	Ah, you made it! This is definitely Reckles's Sword. We finally managed to appease the dark spirit. There is only one thing left to do now.

This battle will be tough, but please, go to the Audience Chamber and destroy Ignatus, then bring me the last of her remains. Our long struggle will finally come to an end once we seal Ignatus’s Tooth.	This will be the toughest battle, but if you trust your courage and ability, you will win.

Asylum was built using ancient techniques. It provides a good opportunity to learn about ancient history. According to my research, there's a Discarded Stone Tablet by the stone statue of a knight inside here. Ancient history is supposed to be recorded on it, but I can't approach the statue because Karencha, a strong werewolf, is guarding it. Bring me the Stone Tablet and I will reward you fairly.	There'll be a Discarded Stone Tablet in the chamber Karencha is guarding. You don't need to risk taking him on, just get the tablet and be careful.	Oh, you found it. But, hmm...

There are so many missing words. I'm sorry but I have another favor to ask you. Of all the chambers here, there's one where the Queen Spider, Cevent, is building a nest. I'm sure I saw another stone tablet in there near a pillar. Since Cevent is there, I'm sure the tablet is already broken, but it should still be quite useful in interpreting this. If you get me the Broken Stone Tablet, I'll reward you generously.	There's a Broken Stone Tablet inside the pillar in the chamber Cevent is guarding. Cevent is a powerful monster, so don't take the risk of taking her down. Just get me the Broken Stone Tablet in the pillar. Be careful.	Hmm, my prediction was right.

Still, people think it won't be that big of a deal even if these monsters join forces. However, according to our recent report, the tribe of Shakhan, Gnoll Chieftain, is also in the Alliance. Tamarai, the right arm of Shakhan, is known to have a Bracelet, evidence of the alliance. If people see the Bracelet, they will change their mind.

The only bad thing about him is he gets absorbed in one thing too much. Well, not so long ago, I heard from him through a Carrier Pigeon.

And the thing is, I had a huge backlog of work needing to be taken care of, so I couldn't go back to find it. What? Why I didn't go searching for it instead of sending pigeons away?

I don't know, but he's really good at getting on my nerves, so I don't want to be involved anymore. Go talk to him yourself.	Go quickly. If I have to spend one more second thinking about him, my nerves will be consumed in a blaze. I don't want that to happen, so go to Dalicent in Laflesia right now.	Welcome. Oh, the rags you're wearing look worse than anything I've ever seen or heard of. Doesn't your skin peel off under those things? Oh dear! Your sword edge is nicked. You should use something better than that... Well, whatever you wear or wield, it's totally up to you. I guess I don't need to bother you. Was there anything else you wanted to see me for?																																								1. Go to Citizen Dalicent in Laflesia.																														290	1560	2074	Abandoned Orchard

He might have forgotten the story again. He should have asked questions if he didn't understand the story. Well, his memory is as short as his clothes are cheap. There's simply nothing I can do about that. Now I need you to bring me a Discarded Fruit from the Abandoned Orchard north of Laflesia. It's just a piece of fruit. It can't be difficult for you. Go now. Blessings to you in the name of the Elementals.	What are you doing here? Go to the Abandoned Orchard and bring me the Discarded Fruit. Blessings to you in the name of the Elementals.	Hmm, had it been like that for a while? Yes, it's not like I thought it would be. As long as you don't eat it, everything should be ok. Now you can throw it away. What? Of course it was just for visual confirmation. You can't possibly think I wanted to eat that. Now I know the cause.

You're not as bright as I thought. Let me explain briefly, then.</n>I am planning to enlarge my Hasesana Orchard. But Hasesana is a very sensitive fruit that can't grow just anywhere. Moisture, temperature, and climate fall have to be perfect for them to grow. So I am researching whether or not I can use the land where Hasesana were traditionally grown.

Use your <HFFFA7272>Collecting Skill<HFFFFFFFF>. </n>May you be blessed by the Elementals.	Yes, this is it. You've done a good job. What? What is this for? Didn't I tell you? I want to use the old orchard again. To do so, I need to catch the culprit that made the orchard like this. Well, it takes more than just defeating one. Complete eradication should follow. Surely you're not going to say you don't know about such basic stuff. Then you asked just for fun? You've got nothing better to do? Well, that's great.

People like me envy you or other people who can do whatever they want to with no restraints. You don't need to worry about being unable to marry someone you love just because of family issues. I really envy you. Haha, that was just gibberish. By the way, Stylist Lincent wants to see you. Go ahead and meet her. May the kind Elementals bless you.	Go quickly to Stylist Lincent in Laflesia. She has quite a quick temper. May the kind Elementals bless you.	Ah, that was you. The adventurer is becoming famous in Laflesia these days. Now that I see you, I see you certainly deserve the reputation. Well, shall we talk about business first?																																								1.

2078	Rodellite	Lincent's Prediction	Laflesia; Lincent	1		13				3	2077	Timorous Cariten	<Stylist> Lincent	<Stylist> Lincent				First of all, I have a question for you. You met Cariten before coming here, right? What do you think of him? You think he pretends to be active but is actually indecisive? Well, in a sense, you're right. He and I had the ceremony of Para Siempre. But that was just the ceremony. Other than that, nothing changed from before to after the ceremony. Pardon? Is Cariten's Para Siempre me? Why, you haven't heard of it? Well, that's just how he does everything. You want to know why he behaves like that? It's because of our families. Family unity is generally weak in the MoonElf community, except for his and mine. Our families are still growling at each other over which one has the oldest history in Laflesia. Isn't it just stupid? I just don't understand why this is important. By the way, I guess I have to do this. Well, before telling you that, can you bring me some Red Divination Grass from Lunaway Swamp? I need the grass to accomplish what I'm trying to do, and I can disclose it to others only when it's completed. Please. May the protection of the kind Elementals always be with you.	Please hurry to find the Red Divination Grass in the Lunaway Swamp. I don't want any more delays. May the protection of the Elementals always be with you.	So, it was there. Then the time is near. Good. In fact, the Red Divination Grass has dropped its Small Tentacles. And that means the most beautiful flower in Khantra, Rodellite is about to bloom.

I can't say for sure the Rodellite bloomed, but if not, it'll happen soon. Now, I need to see the Small Tentacles. First, I need you to defeat seven Small Tentacles south of the Path of Glory. Then I'll check them myself. No matter how indecisive Cariten is, he will make up his mind when I give him Rodellite. Now, shall we defeat some Small Tentacles? May the protection of the kind Elementals always be with you.	Go at once. While you defeat seven Small Tentacles south of the Path of Glory, I will do some research. There will be satisfying results for sure. May the protection of the kind Elementals always be with you.	Well, that's a little disappointing. It might not be the right time yet. But it usually blooms around now? This is confusing.. I need some time to think.						479	Small Tentacle	7																																1.

It might be easier for you to go alone than to take a total novice like me with you. Ok. I'll just leave everything to you. Rodellite has many different meanings since it's so beautiful. For example, giving six Rodellites means I dedicate my passion and love to only you forever. And I'd like to say that to Cariten with this flower. It may give him a chance to break free from the family. To be honest with you, I wish he would give me Rodellites. But if I wait for that to happen, I won't receive the flowers until I return to the Elemental world. So please get six Rodellites from the Small Tentacles south of the Path of Glory and bring them to Safe Keeper Cariten in the north central part of Laflesia. I hope it will make him strong and resolute. May the protection of the kind Elementals always be with you.	Please collect six Rodellites from the Small Tentacles south of the Path of Glory and bring them to the Safe Keeper Cariten, who's in the northen central aera of Laflesia.

So please stop being angry and just help me. You will?. Great! So, this is it. Please take this Unfinished Robe to Kariel,  east of Laflesia. I guess he needs a finished product, but I really don't have enough time to make it. But I think he knows how to complete it, so it won't be much trouble. Thank you.	I am sorry to ask a strong adventurer like you to run such a petty errand, but just help me out this time in good faith, will you? Take this Unfinished Robe to Kariel in Laflesia.	Sumbras said so? Well, I have no other choice then. If he said he's busy, he must really be busy. So now I have to complete this myself. What do you think?

So finishing a robe, after all, is not that difficult. Thank you.	Can you hurry up? I need to finish this robe very soon. Bring me a Nureron Cocoon from the Lunaway Swamp.	You got it!

Many of the citizens are very grateful for your help, so that's why I'm telling you this. In fact, I had negotiations with the Bandillions recently. We all know they are building up their army, so I first wanted to talk to them to resolve this issue in hopes of avoiding war. But we failed to reach a consensus. Samuel, the boss of the Bandillions, said at the end of the meeting that they would leave a document with their opinions under a tree. We could pick it up after everyone left. So now we have to retrieve the Document of Negotiation, but you are the only one we can trust who is strong enough. Please bring me the Document of Negotiation north of the Lunaway Swamp.	They're Bandillions, so you never know what they're going to do. Please be very careful. Retrieve the Document of Negotiation north of the Lunaway Swamp.	You made it! Let me read this. What nonsense.

We have various advantages over them, but we cannot be certain about our victory. So, I'd like to ask you to do this. Defeat their leader, Boss Samuel. When he's gone, the Bandillions will lose their heads and surrender by day's end. Go to Lime Lake, defeat Boss Samuel, and fetch me the Document of Surrender. The fate of the whole city depends on this. Good luck.	Please hurry. We should initiate this first before they attack. Defeat the Boss Samuel at Lime Lake and bring me the Document of Surrender.

We thought we would be able to at least partially make ourselves understood to the elders of the two clans and avoid interference but it turned out to be useless.

That's not the way MoonElves usually live. I do want to be recognized by everyone. If not everyone, at least I want my family to recognize me but if that doesn't work...can you help me?

These can terrify Ronendl better than any other creatures around here. Some may say they're cute, though, and I tend to agree. They're called Broken Avengers. These poor things came into the world because of insane alchemists. As an alchemist myself, I just can't forgive those who would make such a thing. Apart from disregarding the dignity of life, they created things they can't even be responsible for and now they frighten people. What a shame. I'll need to find out who made these.

It's called Wolf's Arrow, and it is very, very rare. Oh! maybe Benincent can fix it! He was one of the most famous craftsmen in Deribelle. Nowadays he's a merchant.

Lamia are birds that, like us, are intelligent, so when somebody approaches they'll just disappear into the world of another dimention. It's hard to spot them, but it won't be too difficult to collect a feather because they shed them when they land.

Do you know about the Remirabul Saibanel Festival? It is a festival where we thank all the Elementals and divine the fortunes of the MoonElves. In fact, it's on of the biggest and most anticipated festivals. And the MoonElf special boar dish that we eat during the climax of the festival is simply indescribable.

But, seeing how Lizio has given this to me, it should be okay to try to find out the truth, right?</n>I've studied the legends about how to call forth the pendant's power…….

The movement of monsters has abruptly stopped near the Road of Joy south of Deribelle and we have not seen any further movement, so either this is their destination or they are trying to distract us. It's really too early to tell. That does not mean we should sit on our hands and do nothing. I gave Archeologist Kiriscent full authority regarding this matter. She is northwest of Deribelle.

Your mission is to find out the current status of the monsters. That sounds like an enormous job, but all you have to do is destroy monsters as usual.

There was a time recently when I went outside the city to run some errands. I strolled out leisurely as it wasn't an urgent matter, but……. I was surprised by a gang of Ghouls and suffered injuries. And because of that, I still cannot move about freely. Now the problem is that one of my customers will be coming here by taking the same route. It will be terrible if he gets attacked, just like I did.

This is not written in any book. This is folklore so you may not have heard it before. Long ago, the MoonElf ancestors who founded Deribelle were expanding their territory northward, and they came across a powerful monster. This monster was beyond description. She had many monsters doing her bidding and she harassed and tormented the MoonElves. Our ancestors gathered people with special powers to fight her. Their combat skills were minimal but they had this special power to permanently seal the target they wanted. In the end, with great sacrifice, she, the queen of monsters, the Queen of the Dead, was sealed away for eternity! That is where the Queen of the Dead is now located.  And now... she is trying to resurrect herself. This is very dangerous. Her power has escaped the seal and is manipulating other monsters! Please report this to the Great Elder Aratama southeast of Deribelle. I have to do more research. May the ancient wisdom and soul of the spirits be with you!	It's now clear she's trying to break the seal! But surely, there's a way to stop her. I have to find out how. Go to the Great Elder Aratama southeast of Deribelle and report this.

Argh, this is my worst nightmare! By now I might be the only one who can remember her. People who rose up against her died in vain before their time. Only a few, including myself, survived till now and If she is let loose again, we have no way to stop her. All we can do is buy more time while Kiriscent finds out ways to reinforce the seal. We should do what we have to do. First of all, fight off one hundred Canedog Combatants and two Wild Liches near the Blood Altar. If my memory serves me right, their job is to provide nutrition the Queen needs. May the guidance of the Elementals show you the light!	I don't know how much time is left for us, but we have to do our best! Fight off one hundred Canedog Combatants and two Wild Liches near the Blood Altar.

Oh, look at me rambling on and on. Anyway, the dung you brought isn't Logos'.

Deribelle was first founded here well over five hundred years ago. And the sole survivor from that time is Elder Aratama.</n>We MoonElves rarely compile historical records due to our longevity, and we find ourselves in difficulty at times because of that.</n>In order to prevent such a thing, I am working as an archaeologist to write some history books. And what I am currently working on is the history of Deribelle. Oh, but I'm not doing just that, of course. I am also carrying out investigations on several other important matters as well. And one of them is about the Queen of the Dead.</n>The legend of the Queen of the Dead was first known around the same time as the foundation of Deribelle. Elder Aratama said so as well. However, Elder Aratama's memory isn't what it used to be, and there are many things he has forgotten. So here I am conducting my investigation by collecting several items like this.</n>Oh. I was getting a bit long-winded there. Could you please get <HFFFA7272>16 Antidote Potions<HFFFFFFFF> from <HFFFA7272>Merchant Velven<HFFFFFFFF> in <HFFFA7272>Southern Deribelle<HFFFFFFFF>?

Why do I need such a thing? Come to think of it, I haven't told you the reason, have I.</n>I believe that Canedogs are a type of Gnoll. My belief is based on the time when the Canedogs first appeared around Deribelle. The area was previously occupied by Gnolls only, but since Deribelle was founded the Canedogs began to appear as well. So I came to think that learning about the origin of Canedogs would enable us to reinterpret the history of Deribelle. That is why I am making such a request to you.</n>You are not quite sure if you understand it or not? Ha ha, well, archaeology is like that, I'm afraid. Just as you thought you were getting to the bottom of it, you run into yet another incomprehensible obstacle. But as you solve away those obstacles you find new answers and more questions.

Recently, I was hunting near the region of the Queen of the Dead with some other hunters from the city when we were attacked by monsters. We managed to escape without any major injuries because Kiriscent and Berceluna had warned us before we left and we prepared accordingly. Howver, during the fighting, I lost my bow. Without it, I can't hunt. I'm sorry, but could you go find the Broken Bow in the region of the Queen of the Dead, southwest of Deribel? May you be blessed with the wisdom of the Elementals.	I would like you to find the Broken Bow near the Queen of the Dead, southwest of Deribelle. May you be blessed with the wisdom of the Elementals!	Hmm... It's badly broken.

Whenever I go hunting, I keep an arrow at my side. Yes, it's quite uncomfortable, but there's a good reason for it. As you know, for a long time, we MoonElves used to have rituals before going hunting. Today, short, simple rituals have taken the place of the traditionally longer ones. Hunters also carry with them a special symbol of their own to prevent injuries and to pay honor to their game. My symbol is an arrow. I think hunting with an arrow by my side is a way of paying true respect to my sport. Well, that's the arrow I've lost. I can vaguely recall where I last had it, but as a hunter who has broken his bow and lost his symbol, I can't leave the city. My pride won't allow it. Can you look for the arrow for me? First, use this Houdian's Work Knife to search the rocks in the Spores of Joy, south of Deribelle. I'm sure my arrow will be stuck in one of the rocks.  Please.

Tor Fortress is a strategic point for us MoonElves as a border with the Orcs. It's obvious we'll sustain considerable damage if the fortress is isolated. And worse yet, the Queen of the Dead might try to resurrect herself in the chaos. We can't let that happen. But most of Deribelle's defense forces are busy fighting off monsters. So I need you once again. Don't worry about defeating them all, of course. Your job is to destroy Mury, who is masterminding this as the leader of Arachnoid Drones in Ancient Parkal. If you succeed, the others will fall apart without their leader, and they won't succeed. The future of Deribelle and Tor Fortress depends on you.

Right now, the amount of cloth circulating in Deribelle is running seriously low. Of course I'm the one who makes the cloth, so I know the reason. It's the increasing monster attacks. I can't get the raw materials I need. Without the right cloth, the quality and quantity of clothes will be affected.

Others may not be taking this seriously, but Berceluna is complaining already that it's hard to find good clothes these days. It's understandable, though since she frequently gets into fights with monsters and it's a nuisance to repair torn clothes every time. Anyway, I don't want this situation to go on any longer, but I can't just wait for the monsters to stop the attacks. So I've started asking excellent adventurers like you to get me raw materials. What I need is Lymen Cocoon. You can find it in Glory Port west of Deribelle, but you must take care. The place is swarming with monsters these days. Be careful, and return safely. May the guidance of the Elementals bring hope to you.	What I need is Lymen Cocoon. You can find it at the Glory Port west of Deribelle, but take care. The place is swarming with monsters these days.

There are ruins of an ancient people who lived there long before the MoonElves. Of course, the place had a different name then, not a shocking one like Blood Altar. The original temple was built to praise the Elementals, but it was destroyed by the Queen of the Dead, along with all the ancient inhabitants. When MoonElves began to live in Deribelle, the place changed. It was no longer a place to praise the Elementals but a fierce battleground where the Queen of the Dead and MoonElves fought fiercely. The Queen slew so many elves their blood covered the altar. Since then the place has been called the Blood Altar and become a place of fear to MoonElves. Even after the Queen was sealed away, elves still avoided that place. But not everybody is afraid. For a Halfling Sorcerer like me, it's a place for new knowledge rather than fear. Anyway, I talk too much. What I ask is not difficult. All you have to do is take this Amber Stone to Observer Elkain. He's protecting the Blood Altar... What? Who is this Elkain? You will know when you get there. Now take this and off you go!	All you have to do is take this Amber Stone to Observer Elkain, who is protecting the Blood Altar.	Welcome, hero.

Lairien, the Stone Statue right in front of you. Lairien is facing his end. He can no longer carry out his duty because too many Elemental Stones were exhausted. So I asked Sorcerer Excador to find some Amber Stone. Amber Stone is like the heart of Lairien and is a fitting tribute to his last moment. The one who successfully completes the quest by bringing the stone is worthy of witnessing the end of Lairien. Yes, you're right. It was Lairien who pointed you out and who needed Amber Stone. Now, move closer to Lairien. Give the Amber Stone to Lairien, protector of the Blood Altar. May the guidance of the Elementals light the hero's path!

As a matter of fact, an object was delivered to me from the Elf village a few days ago. As usual I left Deribelle for a short while to remove the curse on the object, but Green Poison Moths attacked me to try to steal the object. I think the energy of the curse I was removing drew them in. Whatever the reason may be, I failed to lift the curse.

This is not much of a reward, but I want to tell you a story. You may have heard some of this before, but long ago this place was a fierce battleground between MoonElves and the Queen of the Dead. Here, MoonElves collected the energy of the Elementals to seal the Queen and this is where the Queen sent massive forces to prevent it. Blood flowed at this place for ten days and nights. The Queen's forces succeeded in destroying the MoonElf Guards, but the Elves completed the seal at the last moment. So in the end, both sides were devastated. Unfortunately one warrior of the Queen's forces survived. Her name is Queen Firianes... She disappeared after the battle and nobody has seen her since. But recently I've had this ominous feeling. I think she has returned, though I don't know where she is. Aratama was the only MoonElf to survive the battle with the Queen. He may have some insight on how to find her. So young hero, please hurry to Elder Aratama southeast of Deribelle, and convey my concerns. May the guidance of the Elementals light the hero's path!

I was quite troubled as I don't know who could have done this, but Gustof sent me a message just a moment ago. He is not sure whether the tools belong to me but somebody told him that there are some stolen goods in a certain place. If they are mine, I'd really like to get them back. What kind of goods, you ask? They're not anything grand, they're just a tinderbox and an oil bottle, but they are not exactly ordinary. When I left the Elf village, an elder of the village gave them to me. So I really want them back. Fortunately Gustof seems to have some clues about where they are. So go find him and help him.

He said the Spriggans used to sneak into Tor Fortress and steal stuff, but they didn't take the loot to their headquarters. They hid it somewhere else. There must be a reason, but it is not important now. The priority here is finding Gylton's missing goods. I think you already know this but the tinderbox and oil bottle she lost are very valuable. Hmm? You wonder why the tinderbox and oil bottle are so important? Oh. you didn't hear the stories about them? The tinderbox is a wonderful object. It can light a fire even in water and the oil bottle is a magic bottle. I mean literally. It always keeps itself full no matter how much oil you use. If you sold them, the price would be unimaginably high. Ah.. Look at me. I'm bragging about something that isn't even mine. Anyway, let's find them.

A long time ago, a festival to celebrate the year's end used to be held there but nowadays there are too many monsters to hold such a celebration. I didn't get the chance to see the festival myself. Anyway, go to the Lands End area and find the Oil Bottle that Never Runs Dry. If you find it, you don't have to bring it back to me. Take it directly to Traveler Gylton west of Tor Fortress. Well...

This red line is the Spriggan's final defensive line which we secured after we repelled them the last time. As you can see, we forced them to retreat quite far from here thanks to you. The problem is this blue line. This is where Spriggan Chasers and Warriors are waging a fight. You see, the battle zone isn't fixed and spreads over a quite large area. In other words, they're not attacking us in groups but making small surprise attacks on strategic places, giving us a lot of trouble. Without disposing of them, we can't ensure peace in Tor Fortress. That's why I looked for you. It's very hard to find somebody who isn't widely known to Spriggans but has enough ability to fight them off. What you should do now is repel the Spriggan Chasers in the region of the Queen of the Dead and bring back the Chaser's Gloves. Of course I wouldn't send you alone.

Since the queen was sealed with the blood of MoonElves, the fortress didn't become a battleground, even though it was built for that purpose. Ironically, the fortress became very useful in another way. It served as the first barrier to ward off the attacks of Humans. Nowadays we're on good terms with them but in the past, their reckless expansion caused some clashes with us MoonElves. Every time, this fortress acted as the first barrier to ward Humans off.

From a distance, they looked like they're made of simple iron ore, but given the shine and curve of the armor, I think it's something other than iron. It doesn't look like the Ore of Legend either. Still, it came as a big surprise. I didn't think their armor manufacturing skill was that sophisticated. If it's possible, I'd like to inspect one of the armor pieces myself. Can you help me? If you can, go to Storm Road, take down a Spriggan Ironclad Soldier and bring back the Ironclad Soldier's Armor without damage. May the hands of the Elementals lead your way.

Don't look at me like that. I wasn't looking for you because of my personal grudge. I only wanted to deliver a message from my elder sister Sharin Hyren, who is the Elder of the Tor Fortress here.</n>She says that the Spriggan Ironclad Soldiers are growing in strength with each passing day. I hear that it was also them who forced back down the defensive line we had managed to erect after pressing the Spriggan Soldiers. So she wants you to carry out a guerilla assault to eliminate the Spriggan Ironclad Soldiers. The execution has been entrusted to you. It doesn't matter what method you use.</n>Just make sure you eliminate <HFFFA7272>18 Spriggan Ironclad Soldiers<HFFFFFFFF> on the <HFFFA7272>Storm Road<HFFFFFFFF>, she said. I do not know why my sister has such a high opinion of you, but I hope you don't do anything foolish that will disappoint her.

My sister wants to see you in person. I think she has something to tell you directly. So go to my sister, but don't forget one thing. Never mention unnecessary things to her. I respect her. Unlike me, she is a respectable and generous enough person to forgive the sorry excuse of a father we have. But contrary to my sister, I cannot forgive that trash. Never. My sister is worried about me, and I hate to add to her worries. So when you meet her, don't talk about unnecessary things. I talked too long. Hurry up and go to Elder Sharin Hyren at the center of Tor Fortress. May the Elementals take revenge on those who turned their backs on you.

Is she still blaming our father? Yeah, you're speachless now. I know what she's like. I can guess what Sara told you. I see. I'll talk about this some more another time. There is a more urgent matter now. First of all, thanks to your guerilla operation, the strength of Spriggan Ironclad Soldiers has diminished considerably. This is very fortunate for us. But there are some remaining problems. The twin leaders of the Spriggan Ironclad Soldiers, Pamashura and Shamashura are urging their soldiers to penetrate our line of defenses. If it is possible, I'd like to end this battle with Ironclad Soldiers once and for all, but doing so would mean considerable damage to our side also. That is not what I want. So I looked for ways to minimize the damage to our side while defeating the Ironclad Soldiers.... It seems you're the only one who can pull this off. You should take down Pamashura and Shamashura. It will disperse their soldiers. They're in separate locations, so you should start with Pamashura. Destroy Pamashura, one of the twin leaders of Spriggan Ironclad Soldiers, near Dead Line.

It's my greatest pleasure to meet someone as beautiful as you. Heh. Beauty is something we should appreciate whether it exists in the form of a man or woman. Excuse me. Of course I know true beauty comes from a beautiful mind. I also know that you have extraordinary talents that match your beauty. So... What do you think? Can you lend me a hand? There's something I want you to do that is a little bit difficult for me to handle. Recently, I acquired a very interesting piece of information concerning Sara Hyren's father. Of course nobody in the fortress knows about this. Don't ask me where I learned it. That's a trade secret, heh. What is important is that now I know it. Unfortunately I don't know exactly where he is. What I do know is a contract that contains his whereabouts is somewhere in this land. So I want you to find it.

Actually, I have a crush on Miss Sara Hyren. I have confessed my love to her over and over again, but she never answered a word to me. Well, there could be several reasons for that and that's why I'm trying so hard to get in her good graces. I don't think it's a good idea for me to deliver this to her. Think about it. If the messenger bearing this news is me whom she doesn't like that much, she might think I made it up. Wouldn't it be better to get somebody she trusts to relay the message?

Because of this, when you ask questions about the color to travelers that are passing by, you can hear related information that remains in their mind, mostly about things that they've seen.  Of course, most of it is fruitless. Ha ha ha. More importantly, recently, by using this method, we received a bit of truly useful information. Would you like to hear it? There is a road called Gauntlet Pass south of Tor Fortress. It received such a name because a long time ago many travelers stepped onto that road and have never returned. However, a traveler I met not long ago told me that a Black Sword was pegged into a tree south of the Gauntlet Pass. Because it was such an inauspicious image, he said that he did not touch it and simply passed it by. Ha ha ha! That's why I am asking you to go retrieve it for me? Please find and bring back the Black Sword from the tree located south of the Gauntlet Pass.	Please find and bring back the Black Sword from the tree located south of the Gauntlet Pass south of Tor Fortress.	This is it! Yes, this is it for sure. It's that inauspicious black color that I've seen elsewhere. Hmm. It's extremely inconvenient to just put this thing you brought me on the ground to look at it. But I find that I cannot pick it up.

You can deliver it to Silent Riley. Strong Riley... Great Riley! Well, actually he is Archer Armor Merchant Riley... The actual reason that I'm researching the color black, you can say, is for him. And you are curious about this Black Sword, correct? Silent Riley should know everything about this dagger. So go tell him that I asked you to deliver this and casually ask him about it. Forsooth, you may obtain some information that will prove to be extremely helpful in your travels.  You never know. This could be related to Archlord. Ha ha ha! Do you believe that to be mere fancy?

Hmm, I see. Is it from Barun? It seems that I'll be indebted to him again.</n>It is unlike me to reveal this information, but I should tell you about this. A long time ago, when I was still called Silent Riley, I won a fight against a certain warrior. But because this victory was so gruesome, if you asked me to tell you truly who the winner was, I would hesitate. Whatever the true result was, we never met again.</n>One day I received the news that he was dead. And in such a futile way too. So I gathered news about his killer and found out that it was the black knight, Darman.</n>Although, to you, it may seem like I'm doing this for revenge, in reality things like revenge aren't that important to me. I only wish to meet the warrior who can defeat him with my own eyes. Ah, I'm speaking too much. This dagger you've brought is definitely the dagger that Darman used. I can tell just by looking at it. If this is so, then the black sheath that covered this sword must be around somewhere.</n>It is a guess, but I believe that the sheath remains at the <HFFFA7272>heap of stones near the tree at the Gauntlet Pass<HFFFFFFFF> where you found this dagger. I hope that you will return to where the place that you found this dagger and find the <HFFFA7272>Black Sheath<HFFFFFFFF>. I have faith in you.</n>May there be silence of the spirit.

Yes, yes; nothing important. I have a mere trivial problem.What's my problem? Not so long ago, a group of monsters attacked some travelers. Luckily, there weren't any casualties because the fortress guards, including myself, were nearby. It seems that recently, for some reason, such incidents happen frequently. Although for most of them the fortress guards arrive in time to safely rescue the travelers, from time to time there are incidents where this doesn't occur. I tried to find out the source of the problem, but it was not easy. The only thing I found is that the monsters that are attacking are Marylith Nobles. Yes, it was they that we first came into contact with as well. Although the guards sent out their punitive forces several times to conquer the Marylith Nobles, the attempts were not very successful. Because of all of this, we've been worrying about the situation. Even I cannot resurrect those who have died from the attacks of the monsters. What? You will alleviate some of my concerns? Hmm... I agree that worrying alone is not the right thing to do. Okay, then I ask for your help. Please kill 20 Marylith Nobles just south of Tor Fortress. May the spirit of righteousness be realized.

Ah, I'm sorry but there is something I wish to ask of you. A very ill patient came here with the help of the guards. Looking at his condition, it seems that he will require surgery, but... I don't have the padded sleeves that I use during normal abscess surgery, which block bacteria and prevent my own blood from contaminating the patient if I hurt my hand, because there have been so many patients in need of surgery lately that I have not been able to prepare. Although, thankfully, this patient isn't in that much of a hurry, we cannot wait too long. Unfortunately, I cannot leave the patient's side and it's impossible for me to ask the guards. Can you get me 4 Padded Sleeves? You can get them by hunting monsters or you can purchase them from Magic Weapons Merchant Salirenen located in Norine. I hope that you can obtain them for me quickly. I have faith in you. May the spirit of righteousness be realized.	Can you get me 4 Padded Sleeves?

The patient will fully recover if he allows himself to rest for a week. But... there is something on my mind that is bothering me...  Would you be willing to listen? While I was performing the surgery on the patient, he was mumbling to himself in a sort of delirium... I listened to these whispers. There is a famous monster named Manarian among the Marylith Nobles. She is a monster that harries the guards these days because she is so wicked, covert and strong. I think that this patient was attacked by her because he repeated her name throughout the surgery. Not only did he say her name, but he kept repeating his concerns about a certain staff. He probably lost this staff to Manarian. I implore you to dispose of Manarian from the group of Marylith Nobles just south of Tor Fortress and bring back the Noble's Staff. This request may be quite the inconvenience, but I'd still like to request that you to do this. If it's enough for him to earnestly yell throughout the surgery, then it must be very important. If you have the time, I hope that you'll rescue it. May the spirit of righteousness be realized.

Well, it's not that great, but it's an item that I received from the Orc village that I stopped by before coming to Tor Fortress. Normally I have no need at all for such items, so I do not accept them, but since it was the villagers' desire that I do not simply exchange the item for coin, there was nothing I could do but take it. After I left the village and was on my way here, I could not help but decide that the item was useless to me. I've recently thrown it away. I think it's true to say that I've regretted my decision. I don't know how I came to my decision to dispose of it. Perhaps in light of the recent patients that were attacked by the monsters who reminded me of the Orcs. I'm not certain... Anyway, I hope to recover the item, but, as you know, because the urgency of my patients has suddenly increased, I cannot leave this place. Would you find the item for me? Are you willing to do this? Thank you. Then there's no need to delay. When you go down, straight south of Tor Fortress, there is a Grey Valley that goes through the Orcs' land.

Recently my hobby has been seriously disturbed by the Mobet kids. What is my hobby? It's fishing. Leisurely placing the hook that is connected to a string in the flowing water, relaxing and waiting, and then struggling with the fish that tug upon the line... How great is that? But these days, because of those that Mobet bastard children and their continual disruptions, I cannot concentrate on fishing.

Well, the child's energy is so strong that I usually listen to all her requests, but of course, if you don't want to do it, I won't request forcefully. Huh? You will do it? Then shall I tell you the request? The commerce with the Orcs is giving Sara such a headache these days. Of course, this problem not only includes Sara, but the Safe Keeper Leranche as well. Until recently, the commerce that these two have been progressing upon has been going very smoothly. But recently, a problem that they've been dreading has happened. The trade merchants were attacked by monsters. Because of that, they couldn't find any available workers and they've suffered a loss on their trade. If such a thing happens again, they'll probably need to stop the trading, and that will be a sad thing indeed. Sara feels strongly about this, but I also don't desire such an event to occur. That is why I am asking you to help her. Hunt and slay 25 Arkaros Slave Commanders that have been attacking the trade merchants at the Gauntlet Pass and go to Merchant Sara Hyren at Tor Fortress.

Unfortunately, the workers are still not confident about the safety of the trade route. If things remain this way, something may go wrong at the next trade date. Thankfully, it seems that the trade route on the Orc side has been put in order by them to a degree. We cannot fall behind them. Other than the Arkaros Slave Commanders, there is only one group who may disrupt the trade route: the Mobet Kids. Normally, if Arkaros Slave Commanders are not the instigators, they will not come out offensively. If we advertise that the trade route has become this much safer because we have chased them all out, I think that getting the workers would be more easier. Only then can we reopen the trading. So, I'm asking you. Please get rid of 35 Mobet Kids from the Gauntlet Pass just south of Tor Fortress. If we can get rid of them, the trade will be able to resume. May the spirit's revenge turn on those who turn their backs on you.	So, I'm asking you. Please get rid of 35 Mobet Kids from the Gauntlet Pass just south of Tor Fortress.

Since you tell me that she has left because she had some things she needed to do, I should prepare something before she returns. I my not sure if you know, but at Tor Fortress, we give presents to those who've returned from their journey to welcome them back. Of course, the present is expected, but this present is really nice. It's a flower of the small bugs that are scrambling towards a blue branch. Although it can look fairly gross during the day, when you look at it at night it's beautiful because those small bugs receive the blue light that emits from the blue branch and reflect bright blue light. The MoonElves gazed upon this and gave it the nickname of the Lunar Way's Light. And the meaning of the Lunar Way's Light is that we welcome your safe return... I don't think there is a present that's more fitting than this for a lady returning from a short trip. I am talking too much. What I need you to help me with is obtaining these Blue eggplant. They're not easy to obtain. Please break off Blue eggplant that are growing from the tree west of Gauntlet Pass. The color is so noticeable that you should be able to find them quickly. Please do this for me.	Please break off Blue eggplant that are growing from the tree west of Gauntlet Pass. The color is so noticeable that you should be able to find them quickly.

In this season, the place in which one can find these Blue eggplant are rare and, worse than that, the bugs have gone into hibernation and cannot be obtained easily. For as small an amount as to match the size of the tree branches, there is definitely a place where these small bugs can be found. Although this place is far away from Tor Fortress, I think that an adventurer of your skills can get there without much difficulty. There is no need for me to explain further. Please retrieve some Small Bugs from the dried tree in front of the entrance of Milieu. I will place my trust in you and  wait for your return.

Since you have been completely out of sight these days, I thought you're hiding in some place that I don't know about; I was contemplating putting out a reward for you. Huh? You haven't done anything wrong, so why am I thinking about a reward? Ha, ha. Well, that's true.Ah, right, right. There's no time for us to have such idle talk. There is no secret reason as to why I've been searching for you. I've been looking for a way to block the Hobgoblins, as per Sharin's request, but I've found some doubtful facts. I want to go out and investigate this directly, but if I go out there without any protection, I feel that I may be killed. I plan to entrust you with my personal protection. It's not a very hard task. So that I can finish my investigation safely, please kill 20 Hobgoblins around Tor Fortress. If you do this for me, I will be able to then get the information that I need and Sharin can let go of a big concern. Please hurry.	Please kill 20 Hobgoblins around Tor Fortress.

It seems that the Hobgoblins will attack Tor Fortress all at once when the signal flare is discharged, taking advantage of the dark of the night. If we leave things as they are, great damage will occur. Of course, knowing that the attack is coming, our guards will be able to stop them sufficiently, but it's not easy to make a decision on what to do. Events in the world are often unpredictable. Considering this, I was thinking what would happen if we keep the signal flare from discharging? If the signal flare doesn't discharge, they will be nervous and couldn't they then be hushed up? We shall do all that we can possibly do, and Sharin has said such words often as well. Now that the Spriggans are quiet, the Hobgoblins are in an uproar.  The situation is very chaotic, but because there exist trustworthy men like you, even an old man like me can let go of some of his concern. I'm digressing here. You should immediately subjugate Urulka , who is hiding among the hobgoblins around Tor Fortress, and take the Signal Flare that he has to Elder Sharin Hyren in Tor Fortress. She will know what to do with the item.	Subjugate Urulka , who is hiding among the hobgoblins around Tor Fortress, and take the Signal Flare that he has to Elder Sharin Hyren in Tor Fortress.

The person who asked you to do this, Bolanmar, has collapsed. He was wounded by Hobgoblin poison. He managed to hide this fact while giving you instructions but he collapsed where he stood after you left. If the people around him didn't give him the antidote right away, who knows what might have happened? He is much better now, but as there is still a chance that something might go wrong I have a favor to ask of you.</n>Could you get <HFFFA7272>3 Antidote Potions<HFFFFFFFF> and take them to <HFFFA7272>Alchemist Bolanmar<HFFFFFFFF> in the <HFFFA7272>Tor Fortress South<HFFFFFFFF>? You can get the antidote potions by hunting monsters or buying them from merchants. It doesn't matter how you get them, as long as you bring them to him.</n>Ah. And also give him this message when you hand over the potions. That there is no work as important as your own life. Remember that. He sometimes risks his life during his experiment and I am really worried about him. I will be counting on you.</n>May the fair judgment of the Elementals bring glory to your path.	Would you retrieve 40 Antidote Potions and deliver them to Alchemist Bolanmar in Tor Fortress? Please do this. May there be honor in your path in accordance to the fair judgment of the spirit.	Oh my. I still feel dull pain in my head. What is it? My head isn't normal right now but. Huh? This is the antidote potion. I just ran out of what I was drinking, so it's good timing. Thank you. What? The elder asked you to deliver some words to me? No matter how important things are, there is nothing more important than your own life… Well, it's definitely true. Although it depends on the circumstances. Ah, that's right. Because it was brought up, since you are here, help me a little.			191	Antidote Potion	3																																			1.

I would normally like to go around collecting the ingredients myself, but my physical condition isn't well, and after hearing the messages you've delivered from the elder, I cannot, for no good reason, force myself to do this. Don't you agree? And I cannot even push back the project I'm doing. Huh? Why am I in such a hurry? What I'm making right now is a rock that continuously emits a smell that goblins innately detest. Of course, we cannot smell it. It's only effective on goblins. If I can finish this, we will never have to be afraid of those stupid goblins ever again. That is why I am in such a hurry. Don't you understand? I need the ingredients. If I cannot gather it myself, it would be the fastest to request them from an experienced adventurer like yourself. I need you to bring me stone fragments that are only found at the stone heap at Grey Valley. Stone fragments that are lying around here aren't effective.

It would allow the odor to waft away in one direction. Which means a Rare Horn is perfect for it. So, could you get it for me? I'm rather inept when it comes to hunting, you know.</n>Yes, yes.

But I don't have much time myself, so I am looking for someone who can get it done as soon as possible.</n>You will help me? Oh, thank you so much. I can now breathe a sigh of relief. I've been making a suit of scale armor at the behest of the Elder. By the way, this scale armor is simply amazing, unlike any other: smooth, warm, well ventilated, and very strong. But I faced a problem as I was making this armor. I obtained most of the scales needed for making it, but I am awfully short of Thin Tails that are used as a finishing material. To be honest, I didn't expect to use Thin Tails at all while making the armor.</n>So I would like to ask you to go to the Wind Plain of Silancium to kill <HFFFA7272>Arkaros Slave Commanders<HFFFFFFFF> and use your <HFFFA7272>Collecting Skill<HFFFFFFFF> to obtain <HFFFA7272>9 Thin Tails<HFFFFFFFF>.

The hunt wasn't a big deal, but he broke his legs after falling from a tree and had to return in the middle of it. I supposed anyone can fall from a tree, but I don't know what business a Centaur has climbing a tree at first place. Maybe he thought having four legs and two arms would help him to climb the tree better? The logic escapes me completely.</n>Anyway, I have no idea what he was thinking, but he asked me to finish the hunt for him. But I am a complete novice when it comes to hunting. That is why I am asking for your help. Will you help me?</n>Thank you, I appreciate it. Then please go to the <HFFFA7272>Gauntlet Pass<HFFFFFFFF> and hunt <HFFFA7272>20 Young Gorgons<HFFFFFFFF>.

Since I believe that if I use a treatment potion this pain will disappear rapidly, I am planning to try it, but I've smashed all the treatment potions that I had prepared for the hunt when I fell from the tree. This is why I'm asking; do you have any Large Life Potions with you? If not, I was hoping that you can find some and bring them to me. Of course, I promise appropriate compensation for it.

I feel like all my hair will completely fall from the stress. Ah! What am I going to do? Can you think of any solution? What? Don't I have a spare key? You are right, a spare key! I did have one. Let's see. Where is the spare key? Ah, yes, I left it there. When I was making the safe, I thought that if I had the spare key as well, it would be a big problem if someone with bad intentions found both keys, so I left the spare key elsewhere. Because I don't have it with me, I completely forgot about its existence. Thanks to you, I've remembered. But there's another problem.  That spare key is fairly far from this place. What? Where is it? I left it in a box at the Village of Rest in the land near the Orcs. I thought that it would be really safe there because, most likely, no one would question it being there.

First, listen to my story. Of course, the reason why there was no key is because I lost it, but there is a reason why I lost it. It's the Centaur Calvary. If I remember correctly, it was three days ago. That day, the weather was so bright that it put me in a good mood and I ended up going on a picnic on outskirts of Tor Fortress. Because I was so happy, I packed lunch for the first time in a while and put herbs on my skin so I would not burn. I got ready and went out to picnic. The scenery was amazing and the lunch that I packed was delicious. Needless to say, it was the best! But just then the Centaur Cavalrymen suddenly appeared and started to attack without warning. Thankfully, I hadn't gone far from the fortress so I was able to safely escape. While I was running away, I lost all the things I had brought with me and the Safe key was among them. Ah, you probably don't know how pent up I feel. But who else can I tell that I ran away abruptly from monsters?  If I did, it will be a blow to this safe keeping business that I'm doing. Anyway, I cannot just back away like this, so please help me.  Please eliminate 25 Centaur Cavalrymen to the south of the Gauntlet Pass. Please exact my revenge.

Getting upset will not help me now, so I must compose myself. First, we have to retrieve the safes. Although I want to thin their group as much as possible, even if you have to withhold from doing that, you must retrieve the safes. That is very important. If you do not, I could lose my job.

Did I hear it wrong and is he actually in the process of installing them? Well, I don't know either way, but more importantly I saw Hobgoblins loitering around the fortress these past days. They didn't attack or anything, so I didn't needlessly provoke them either, but I don't think it's a good idea to just leave them alone. Can you help me chase out the Hobgoblins? Hmm, I have to tell you one thing: Since Hobgoblins obey their leaders absolutely, we only need to defeat the Hobgoblin Leaders.

There is a reagent that I need for this lecture on magic, but how can I go look for it with my body in this condition? I should take Tylon's advice and get some rest, but I cannot miss the lecture. So, I'm looking for someone who can get some Reagents for me. Can you help me? What I need are the Maran Moonstones that can be obtained from the stone heap in the Wind Plain. The Maran Moonstone is a stone that gives mana to young MoonElves that have little mana. It is a great help when giving a magic lecture.  Because it's small, it's easy to carry around, but the downside is that the small stone can only be used once. It's of no help other than for the lectures. But for young MoonElves that've just had their eyes opened to magic, it is help enough. If I could I would go get it myself, and get a lot, but because my body is in this condition I could not give a long lecture anyway so all I need is one small stone. I am entrusting you with this task. May the aide of the spirit be with you.	Can you get a Maran Moonstone  from the  stone heap in the Wind Plain? I am entrusting you with this task.

There were many young MoonElves that displayed plentiful magical abilities. They probably have better abilities than myself, ha-ha. But I have spoken too much on irrelevant matters. I plan to find a Wyvern eye this time, but my magic ability isn't high enough. Can you hunt Dark Wyverns for me?  If you slay a Dark Wyvern, I will take the eye from the Wyvern. Ah-hah, I didn't tell you how I'll use it. I'm planning to use it during magic lecture. This time, I plan to teach how to summon spirits using material elements. It's for the young MoonElves that haven't come into a contact with the spirits; they need material elements to summon them. Wyvern are very appropriate for this task, ha-ha. Shall we start then? Please hunt 10 Dark Wyverns at the Gauntlet Pass just south of Tor Fortress. I will take the Wyverns' eyes after they have been slain. May the help of the spirit be with you.

2443	Bibulan's magic class	Wyvern's wings	Tor Fortress; Bibulan	1		43				3	2442	Dark Wyvern	<Magic Trainer> Bibulan	<Magic Trainer> Bibulan				Hmm, it seems I have thought wrong. I believed that I had collected all the materials I would need, but there is one thing lacking. I'm lacking Wyvern wings. It would have been nice to obtain them while you were hunting the Wyvern just now, but I completely forgot. The use of Wyvern wings? Although now Wyverns live on the ground most of the time, they used to spend most of their lives flying in the wide blue sky. The reason that Wyverns could fly like that was the high magic imbued into their wings. Although they lost most of that magic, and often live on the ground, Wyverns that still fly can be observed. </n>The result of my various research shows that as Wyverns walk the earth, they collect mana on their wings and store them.  And if the mana becomes similar to the amount they had in the past, they can fly into the sky. But because the consumption of the mana is extreme, they must come back down right away.  Either way, the fact that the Wyverns' wings can store up mana is true. And by using them, teaching the young MoonElves how to use mana has gotten a lot easier. I can provide them with an example. So you could say that it is a essential material. Because of that, can you catch Dark Wyverns on the Gauntlet Pass once again, and retrieve the Wyvern Wings? I trust you will accomplish this.May the aide of the spirit be with you.	Because of that, can you catch Dark Wyverns on the Gauntlet Pass once again, and retrieve the Wyvern Wings?

But, actually, my dishes do not taste as good these days. Ah, don't misunderstand me. I'm not saying they taste bad. It's just that I cannot say that they're vastly better than several other MoonElf cooks. I've done some research into the cause and I got an unexpected answer. This is why I'm asking whether or not you have any Large Life Potions by any chance? If you do, would you give me 40 Large Life Potions? Of course I will compensate you with a dish that is so good that it has no equal. If you do not have any, could you get some for me?

These Moss are natural seasonings, so you can say that they take up the most important part of my dishes. Obviously, uncivilized races do not know the effect of the Moss at all and they just ignore them. You could say that's why their dishes taste so bad. Even if people tell them that they're are uncivilized, they can do nothing about it, right? Ha-ha-ha.

But the general consensus is that no other ingredient can captivate the palate of gourmands as well as raw meat.</n>Oh ho. You understand it well. That's right.

My head is hurting because of those useless people that have butted into the business of trade. Please don't bother me. What? You might be able to help me? Hmm, you may be right. If it's not someone like you, whom doesn't know how to do anything but fight, then no one can help. I should tell you my problem first. I must say, Leranche and I started trading with the Orcs not long ago. The business was going well. Although monsters cause trouble here and there, it has been going forward without any big problems. Recently, the monsters' actions have become strange. Even the ghosts, that would normally never attack the itinerant merchants, started attacking them. So I'm looking into what is behind these events. If the attack on the merchants increase, we have no choice but to give up the trade. I do not wish this at all. While I'm doing the investigation, I would like you to protect the merchants. It's not a very hard job. You'll have to hunt the Ghost Thieves. The things that are happening around the Orcs' territory will be taken care of by them, so you just need to get rid of 20 Ghost Thieves<HFFFFFFFF> from the <HFFFA7272>Gauntlet Pass<HFFFFFFFF>.

I also need someone who can make a precise argument with that proof. First, the proof. Find the Marks of a Thief from the old tree in the Milieu Island. It seems that the Marks of a Thief is using the Ghost Thieves to attack the merchants. Maybe if you remove the Marks from that place, they'll stop attacking the merchants. I have not tested this, so I don't know. Regardless, when you find the Marks, go to Elder Sharin Hyren in Tor Fortress. I am referring to my sister.

This is something that needs to be done in order to protect the merchants. The merchants are scheduled to leave a little later. No. They aren't the merchants that just arrived, but our own merchants that are leaving for Orc territory. Because the preparation against the Ghost Thieves isn't complete, we are estimating a big loss. Then shouldn't we postpone it? There is logic in what you say. It's wrong to go forward with the work when you know that there will be losses. But, alas, we cannot do that. Trade, especially the promise of trade made with other races, is an important part of our society. We have no choice but to send them off with the the best of our protection.  Yes, hunt 35 Ghost Thieves from the Gauntlet Pass. If you succeed in this, the merchants will be able to go to the Orc territory without much of a problem, and we will earn enough time to come up with a decision regarding the Ghost Thieves.

Hmm, then even if you don't have any business with me, I have business with you. Oh, that face shows that you are interested. Good. Then, I will tell you my business. In a few days, the MoonElf's memorial event, Pangaroon, will approach. Well, it doesn't have much to do with a foreigner like myself, but for the MoonElves... Especially for their young, this is an extremely important event. It's an opportunity for the MoonElves to memorialize those who bore and raised them;  yes, what we would call parents. Huh? You don't understand?  Fine, then I will say it simply. Simply put, it's a day for the MoonElves that are living to memorialize the MoonElves that are dead through a festival.  We would never have a festival during a memorial event, but it is very becoming to the MoonElves. It is a clear fact that this festival is their memorial event. But these days the Mobet Largewings are so ill-natured that Sharin is extremely worried. This festival doesn't matter to me, but as long as I am Sharin's godfather, I cannot just sit and watch that child worry. In the midst of all this, you have came.

You must remember. This is about the Mark of a Thief that you've told me about. We have gathered some information about it. Of course, it is too early to jump to any conclusion with so little information, but that the Queen of the Dead is connected to them seems to be a fact that cannot be doubted. Because of that, I am collecting more detailed information from all sides, but…of all the information we have currently, there is nothing to doubt the fact that the Centaur Wind Runners are connected to this incident. To be precise, we received information that Centaur Wind Runners are acting under the command of someone... But we cannot find out what it is they have been doing. Because of this, I have a request for you. While our informants are collecting information, it is my hope that you can distract the Centaur Wind Runners. This is not a difficult task because you just have to draw their attention. Please slay 5 Centaur Wind Runners from the Wind Plain. You just need to draw their attention towards you.  Anything more than this is too reckless, so I ask that you control yourself. May there be honor in your path according to the fair judgment of the spirit.

The informants just finished analyzing the information…but…there is a slight problem. Because their information is so comprehensive, we cannot figure out what they ultimately want. We cannot put forth any conclusion in this way. Thankfully, we were able to verify one thing: the Centaur Wind Runners are devising something using a Rough stone of the wind. If this is true, we can obtain a Rough stone of the wind directly and go forward. According to the information, we will be able to find out what they ultimately want. But because we don't have Rough stone of the wind prepared in advance, we need to get plenty of them from somewhere. Because of this, I wish to make a request from you. Hunt Centaur Wind Runners from the Wind Plain and bring back 1 Rough stone of the wind. May there be honor in your path according to the fair judgment of the spirit.

I'm still in the middle of the experiment, but I have a more urgent problem than that. Maybe it's due to the fact that since we are checking up on Centaur Wind Runners, we were lacking in preparation against other monsters, but a group of Marylith Sailors have attacked our guards. They seem to be motivated to break up the concentration of our forces because when our guards didn't run after them, they returned and attacked half-heartedly, then retreated and repeated this. As long as this is their intention, we cannot move according to their will. Because of this, I plan to borrow your strength. Please eliminate 25 Marylith Sailors from the Road of Entry. Even with just that much, they will be frightened and run away. We already discovered who is behind them. It's the Centaur Wind Runners. When we finish the experiment, we will find out who it is they fear and who is causing them to do these things.  I ask you to stop them in the meantime. May there be honor in your path according to the fair judgment of the spirit.	Please eliminate 25 Marylith Sailors from the Road of Entry.

It's certain that they begun this work on the command of the Queen of the Dead. The reason? Look at this. Is this the first time you've seen it? You are correct, this is a Rough air stone. It's something you can obtain from an Wind Elemental Stone. Basically by repeating these steps, the elemental stone will wield more power, but if you make the rough stone from the lowest elemental stones using a special method, the original power disappears and instead, they will absorb a different power. If one collects all types of rough stones in this way, no matter how strong a protective shield is, it becomes possible to break it. That's right. It's certain that the Queen of the Dead still cannot come outside of the protective shield. That is probably why she is making the monsters do this work. But thanks to you, it has become clear what we have to do.  We have to make sure that the monsters do not obtain these rough stones. There is something I want to ask of you. Once again, eliminate  Centaur Wind Runners from the Wind Plain and obtain Four Rough Air Stones. May there be honor in your path according to the fair judgment of the spirit.

I was just contact by Mr. Laurelluna, the blacksmith of Deribelle. He wanted someone to get some seaweed that can only be obtained from Dead line.

Kiriscent finished some new research not long ago. They say that according to the research, we are able to find out how the Queen of the Dead forces the other monsters do their jobs. Because of this, I have some things I wish you to do for me. If you go near Grand Crimson, someone named Lariane leads the Fountain Lamias. They say that, unlike the other monsters that directly attack travelers, she does nothing, but this is not true. She may only talk, but she is the mastermind of everything. The proof is the ring that she has. That ring transmits the intentions of the Queen of the Dead to her and she spreads these intention to the other monsters. Now that we've found out this fact, we should stop her, correct? This is why we need your power. Defeat Lariane who is at Grand Crimson, find the Queen's Ring and deliver it to Elder Sharin Hyren at Tor Fortress. She will be able to use her wisdom to judge accordingly.

Of course you eliminated Lariane, but we cannot look at Lariane as the only suitable cause. I believe there is a high possibility of another suitable source within the Fountain Lamias. If so, we should hunt the Fountain Lamias first. I've told the guards this story too, so they will start hunting very soon. But we shouldn't delay while they are getting ready.  I will entrust this task to you. While the guards are getting ready, go to the Grand Crimson area and slay 20 Fountain Lamias. Around the time you finish hunting, our guards will arrive.

Without this Rough River Stone you brought me, I wouldn't have known where to start.</n>But since we now know where to begin, how we do it is more or less decided, I say. Lamia normally live in a congregation. They all look like females, but they actually have no gender distinction. I guess you could say that they self-fertilize? An individual lays eggs by itself, and the hatchlings become the young of all Lamia. There are still many questions left unanswered regarding their lifestyle, but I think what we know is enough to find a way to eradicate them......</n>There is something we need, though. It's the scales, and they are needed for cutting this Rough River Stone. I need them to carry out Sharin's plan, as well.

No, I'm not planning on leaving the town right now. In fact, I don't want to leave this place right now. Do you think I should prepare the equipment properly? That's why I'm working on this. What is happening today? What? You just stopped by because the weather is nice? Ha, ha. You are funny. Now that you mention it, the weather really is quite nice. It makes me want to go picnicking. Ah, that's right. Even if I wanted to go on a picnic, I heard from Elder Sharin that the Marylith Sailors are so ill-tempered, I should restrain from it. Is that true? I'm a stranger to this place, which could make going on a picnic difficult, but if the monsters are causing enough trouble to prevent everybody from picnicking, then that is an altogether different problem. I won't be of any help if I go forward because I have no battle skills. Can you help me? You will? Good. Then hunt 20 Marylith Sailors from the Vicinity of Wind Plain. If you do that, they will no longer disturb any picnickers.	Please hunt 20 Marylith Sailors from the Vicinity of Wind Plain.	Good job. Thanks to you, people can go picnicing in peace.

My relationship with Gustof isn't what you think, and Leranche knows that to a certain degree. It's irrelevant to me. More than anything, I want to be close to Leranche. She possesses vitality and looks happy. What can I say? She's resembles me before I left my home. Perhaps it's it's a result of my long journey that I cannot laugh as easily as I used to. She can, though, and is very lovable because of it. I've talked too much. What I want to request of you is small. Catch Young Harpy from Dusty Creek and get 1 Rough Meditation Stone.

It seems to me that you have gained so much experience that most things don't even make you flinch... Is it too early to be satisfied with the amount of experience you have? I'm going to propose something that will add vitality to your adventures. Listen, for over 100 years, the Old Candle served to restore connections between people. Those who have not communicated for a long time would get Old Candles and send them to their friends with the intention of remembering their friends' faces looking at this candle. It looks like you know all of this very well. Then what about this one? The ultimate adventurer of Tor Fortress, Sir Barun, is an old friend of one of the Orc adventurers, Felicia. Isn't that surprising? It's an extremely amazing thing to be friends for so long with an Orc whose life was cut short because of war. It's been a very long time since they have communicated. Huh? Why am I speaking in such a roundabout manner? Ha, ha. You definitely understand me, perhaps because you are so used to adventure. Fine. Then, I will ask you.

Before chasing out the Harpies, I'd want to make some preparations, and I'd like you to help me. Among the trees in the Bump Field, there is an extremely Old Tree.

It's a very similar idea to humans making a scarecrow to chase away sparrows that invade their fields. Harpies aren't as stupid as sparrows, but this thing should be sufficiently helpful in driving them away. But currently there isn't enough material for it. One more thing I need is the moss that emits a smell that Harpys really hate. If I just paste this onto the structure, young Harpies will never again be able to attack our Zylok.

Letche coordinated the Marylith Countesses and attacked my cargo. I wanted to take revenge on him, but because he is such a cunning guy, he never shows his face. That's why it is hard to take my revenge on him. But because of an exceptional scheme devised by Mr. Seena, you have reduced the number of Marylith Countesses, and now Letche has no choice but to move around. This is the best chance we have to defeat Letche and to take revenge for my cargo. So, I am hoping that you can defeat this Letche. And one more thing: bring back Letche's necklace.  I will sell the necklace and so be compensated for the damage done to my cargo. Catch Letche at the Dusty Creek and bring back his necklace.

I need someone to find a certain item from far away. What I need is the broken foot of a broken statue in the Battna Site. The reason I need it is I'm planning to erect a fresh statue, and I need to use it as the base support. Of course, I'm not using the foot in the statue itself, but merely to create the foundation. I'm planning to make a strong statue that will not break again. Can I ask you to do this? May the spirit's divine protection go with your footsteps.	Please get the broken foot of the broken statue in the Battna Site. May the spirit's divine protection go with your footsteps.	Oh. This must be the broken foot of the broken statue. Evidently…they were able to make such an elegant statue in the past. Huh? How can I tell by just looking at the foot? If you have as much interest in statues as I do, you can imagine the whole thing by just looking at the foot. Yes, there is another thing I want to ask of you.

I thought I had gathered enough, but now I see I was wrong.  So, I was hoping that you could come up with the materials that are lacking. What I need is early morning dew. This dew is magic because it has the effect of making the materials that go into the statue into one lump. Although that doesn't mean that it really contains magic… Calling it a wonder of nature would be more appropriate. If I don't have that wondrous dew, there will end up being another newly broken statue. Don't you think I should avoid such a thing? So, I'm hoping that you'll find this for me. Please find early morning dew from the Temple of Time. It's located in Orc territory so please be careful not to be too impertinent.  I will entrust you with this.

Because it's not that rare for Night Bucks to come around here, I did not pay much attention to them, but it turned out that the swarm attacked the laborers that were working on the statue. The workers are now saying that if their safety cannot be guaranteed, they cannot work any longer. Of course, because they are people from Tor Fortress, they know very well what important work it is to build this statue. This statue is made by transferring the broken Batna Ruins statue and will be used to solidify their friendship with the Orcs.  If such a thing is put on hold because of the attack, this will cause problems. So I'm hoping that you get rid of the Night Buck in order to give relief to the workers. Please catch 23 Night Bucks from Wasteland. May spirit's divine protection go with your footsteps.	Please catch 23 Night Bucks from Wasteland. May spirit's divine protection go with your footsteps.

Today, you are as beautiful as those bright flowers. You could say that the fact that I'm able to see such a beautiful one must be a blessing of the gods, right?  Ha ha. Please don't look at me with that face. Because it's not a joke. There is one thing I want to ask of you. Do you have the time?  If so, what do you think about coming here and having tea with me while we talk? I know you want me to just tell you what it is I want... You are as cold as always. But that is another one of your charms. Ha ha. Fine. I will tell you my business. It's just that, not long ago, I was contacted by Benincent of Deribelle. He says that he is looking for a skilled adventurer. But apparently the only one around me with skills exceptional enough to satisfy Benincent is you. So, I am hoping that you'll meet with him. But if you go empty-handed, Benincent will not trust your skills. So find spores from the Spores of Joy and deliver them to Deribelle's Archer Weapons Merchant Benincent.

Thankfully, with the help of an adventurer who was traveling around, I was able to find the letter again and get it delivered safely to Remulos. But such an event cannot be just overlooked. If we ignore the monster that attacks postal workers, a serious break in the chain of communication between MoonElves could occur. I couldn't just sit back and watch that happen, right? So, that's why I asked Remulos to find an exceptional adventurer for me. You have exceptional skills and are the person best suited to this task. Would you take on the task? Thank you.

The location they are looking at seems to be Grey Valley, that connects Trilgard and Tor Fortress. If we end up losing that location to the monsters, the communication line between us Orcs and you MoonElves will break and can cause disorder. That is not something any of us want.

It doesn't look like there is much left that I can teach you, you know? It means you have improved in leaps and bounds. That doesn't mean you can afford to be complacent, though. You just don't know when something unexpected might hit you. Well, it's the same for me too, of course. Hahaha.</n>Ahem. I didn't keep you here for some idle chatter, though. I want your help.</n>As an archer trainer, I look after many novice archers. They are just beginners, and their skills can't be compared to yours, of course. And for those guys, equipment is just as important as their skill. It gets very difficult for them if they don't compensate for their inexperience with decent equipment.</n>So I've been trying to make special arrows for them, but I don't have enough materials. So, I want you to help me with collecting those materials. The first thing I need are the Rare Feathers.</n>Use <HFFFA7272>Collecting Skill of Level 3 or higher<HFFFFFFFF> on the <HFFFA7272>Thunder Griffins<HFFFFFFFF> inhabiting <HFFFA7272>Wasteland<HFFFFFFFF> to get <HFFFA7272>2 Rare Feathers<HFFFFFFFF> for me.

Hm. Good. I'm glad I asked you to do this. The quality is very good. There is no blood on it, and the tight skin is well and alive. This will be enough to make an excellent arrow plume. Ah.

Even if one has an exceptional arrow, if one does not have a target for sharpening and polish, it's merely a decoration. I would like to give you an arrow, but it's a bit shameful to give you such a thing without a suitable target to aim it at. So I was hoping that you'd bring back some things that can be used as targets. What would be good is, hm, Let's think about this. Ah. That's right. The Dirt Field near Zylok is famous for Griffin nests and as a place where the eggs hatch. The egg is as large as a normal adult male of our species, which means it's really big. But it's just right as a target. And anyway, if we can eliminate these monsters' eggs, we can decrease the number of monsters we need to face in the future. It's like killing two birds with one stone. So, go to the Dirt Field immediately and get Griffin eggs. Do a good job.	Go to the Dirt Field immediately and get Griffin Eggs. Do a good job.	Huh.

So, I'm planning to go rescue him, but it's a bit too much for me to handle myself.  I will ask you to do nothing further. Please eliminate 25 Centaur Airbornes from Wasteland.

He has no external wounds, but he's continually suffering from high fever. We presented him to pharmacist Tylon, who claimed that there's no external or internal injury, but it could be a mental problem he's acquired due to dehydration. He said that the best way for him to recover is on his own, but I'm worried about that. I want him to wake up as soon as possible, so I asked the pharmacist what I could do. He said that there is a certain herb. No. I won't ask you to bring back the herb. This is something I should do as the teacher of this disciple. But I feel that I'd be too late just running there.  So, what I want to ask you is to get 6 Large Quickness Potions. It doesn't matter whether you get it from monsters or buy it from a merchant, but please get it for me fast.

Current trade with the Orcs is showing promise and has gained a degree of stability. We are planning to create a new trade route, which won't be easy. I'm hoping that you can help me with the new trade route. If this works out well, our Tor Fortress will be the center of trade in the eastern Chandra. What I want to request from you is your assistance in the elimination of dangerous elements, in the form of the Centaur Hunters, who are active around the Wind Plain.

They didn't have any reason to refuse this business, which makes them the center of northern continent and the western and eastern continent. But this is where the problem is. What they requested from us first is high quality potatoes. Why is that a problem? Although I'm working as a merchant, I don't deal with potatoes, so it becomes a problem.  But I don't want to bow to that stupid Lardet. So, I'm sorry, but can you get some potatoes for me?  I don't need a lot. I just need several as samples. Please get 20 potatoes.

If the monsters that are blocking the trade route do not get completely eliminated, they don't want to risk the danger. Actually, I would have said the same thing, so I can understand their request. So I must consider their request. If we do this, then we will have the upper hand, and we can get even more profits this way. And I am requesting you to do this, since it's not easy to find someone as experienced as you around here. Remove the Centaur Airborne from the Wind Plain and eliminate Aigle, and bring back Aigle's bracelet as the proof. If we give that over to them, they won't say anything.

But while they were returning with the potatoes, they were attacked by Centaur Airbornes. Because Aigle had disappeared, it wasn't a large coordinated attack, but it was enough for a portion of the cargo to be taken. Because of that, I could not match the quantity that was asked for. I don't know what will happen in the future if things go wrong at the supply end of the trade. So I'm hoping you can help me.

Now that I think about it, you always come around when I have a problem. Or is it that when you come around, a problem arises? I don't know if I should call this a fortunate thing or a problem. First, let's resolve the problem. Do you know about the Vampire Village? It's a village populated by vampires who are led by a very powerful vampire named Ignatus. They may be planning to start something, their numbers are multiplying. I don't know what they are going to do, but it won't be good. Furthermore, the place where they gather is, of all places, not far from Hideback Village and the trade route. It's threatening no matter how you look at it. I want to take care of them before it is too late. Do you understand what I'm saying? If so, the story will be simple. Please eliminate 26 Vampire Knights at the Vampire Village. That will be enough to keep them from acting indiscriminately. May there be spirit's revenge to those who turn their backs on you.	Please eliminate 26 Vampire Knights at the Vampire Village.

If they start to increase their numbers with all their might, we will soon be overwhelmed by them. To prevent this and to keep them from getting too close, we should use something against them that they are afraid of. The problem lies in finding what it is they're afraid of. Apparently, from what I hear, they created the village to safeguard exactly what they fear. What they are afraid of is a certain tree branch, and I'm sure that it's probably in the center of the village. This is what I want to ask from you. Please get the Tree Branch from the Vampire Village. May there be spirit's revenge to those who turn their backs on you.	Please get the Tree Branch from the Vampire Village.

It's just…… I now know what black to red refers to.</n>Black is the color of shadows and darkness, and also the color of Darman who wears black armor. Then perhaps we could interpret that black changing to red signifies his death and the blood he spilt? The Darman's Helmet you brought to Barun probably implies the same thing.</n>But, I can't accept this at all. He should have died after a duel with me. I can't forgive him for dying so early. And those who killed him, as well. Since we don't know where his body is, the first thing that must be done is avenging his death.</n>But the killers aren't so weak that we can just charge at them.

Perhaps if someone like you gives me some help, I might be able to alleviate a bit of the pressure that I am under now.</n>What actually happened is that I was able to sell many weapons recently due to the monster attacks. But the monsters were too strong, and apparently my weapons weren't much help to my customers. And many actually came back to ask me for refunds. As a merchant, there was nothing I could do.

Of course, I don't believe that the swarm can be eliminated right away. First, we need to weaken their ability to group together. And that is why I asked you to destroy Lamia Witches as a test.

Actually, I am taking the role of the director of the hunting season that's going on in the Fortress. However, not many hunters have gathered. Since we lost the game that we had targeted, we cannot possibly fill the target amount. So you need to help me fill the target amount. Sounds okay, right? Good.

Even the gathering of the Redflag Sentry seems to be caused by her growing influence. However, we need to extinguish the fire that's more urgent than her right now. Either way, I hope that you can help us so that the MoonElf travelers can travel in peace. First, eliminate 30 Redflag Raiders at the Hawk's Plateau.

Recently, there have been incidents of travelers from Laflesia being attacked on their way to Hideback Village. As you probably have guessed, the Redflag Raiders are responsible. It seems that there is division within their group. That means the group that you eliminated was only a portion of them.

Ah, it was you. It's fate that you've come all the way here. So can you listen to one request? It's just that the merchant that brought me the medicine was attacked by Duriven Slugs and lost all the medicine he was bringing. He is ill and in the back as one of my patients. Because it is too hard to go over the Wanderer Plain, he asked me to somehow help reduce the number of Duriven Slugs. But it's hard for me to go there myself and leave all my patients here.

It's just that there is a bit of a complicated problem related to trade. Several of the merchants that left Hideback Village just arrived at Tor Fortress. But they lost most of their goods, and those who were travelling with them. Plus, everyone has been hurt seriously. Right now, pharmacist Tylon is looking after them, but I heard a bit of a concerning story from them. While they were passing the Fallen Hills after leaving Hideback Village, big rocks were falling. But it has been a very long time since there has been any landslide there. It's been so quiet, that the name Fallen Hills became a relic of the past. But many rocks fell in that place, and the fact that those boulders fell exactly on the merchants makes it seem that there is something dubious about it. So I want to do some investigation. Can you help me? Good. Perhaps because adventurers are perceptive, you know what I mean. I'm sure that the falling rocks were deliberately created by some monsters. But it's still too early to say. I need a definite proof. And there is something you need to get for me in order to find that proof. Bring back Broken Pieces of the Cargo Box from the Fallen Hills that's if the pieces of the cargo are still there. May there be spirit's revenge on those who turn their backs on you.	Can you hurry? Bring back Broken Pieces of the Cargo Box from the Fallen Hills. May there be spirit's revenge to those who turn their backs on you.	These are the cargo pieces but it's strange.

This must have been instigated by monsters. And I think I know who they might be. But we will need more solid proof.</n>You want to know why we need proof when we are just fighting monsters? There is also some truth in what you are saying. We could indeed solve this matter by hunting those monsters. However, just looking to slaughter every monster in sight is not always for the best. As we face more and more monsters, it is inevitable that we suffer losses of more men and resources.</n>So in order to minimize those losses, we need to eradicate those that harm us directly first. This way is much more efficient and we also suffer less losses.</n>Ah, I went on babbling there, sorry about that. Okay, to start off I want you to hunt the <HFFFA7272>Duriven Slugs<HFFFFFFFF> in <HFFFA7272>Evor<HFFFFFFFF> and use <HFFFA7272>Collecting Skill of Level 9 or higher<HFFFFFFFF> to obtain <HFFFA7272>2 Finest Leather<HFFFFFFFF> for me.

While you were dealing with them in Evor, our Tor Fortress scout discovered different Duriven Slug groups moving the cargo at the Wanderer Plain. I want to go directly to find that cargo, but there is something that needs to be resolved before then. We need to eliminate the Wild Busters that the Duriven Slugs had raised to be hunters. Wild Busters are Wild Hawkarrows that were raised to be hunters, so they are appropriate attackers for Duriven Slugs. If we attack the Duriven Slugs at the Wanderer Plain without reason, I don't see many good things happening to us. So first, hunt 30 Wild Busters from the Wanderer Plain. It won't be too late to go into the main point later. May there be spirit's revenge on those who turn their backs on you.	Hunt 30 Wild Busters from the Wanderer Plain.

Well, it would have been more strange for them not to have found that out. But instead of helping the Wild Busters that were getting attacked by you, it seems that they started to raise new Wild Hawkarrows. If we leave them be, it will be dangerous. Plus, the Wild Hawkarrows have also been responsible ones for always bothering our merchants. It doesn't seem like a bad idea to eliminate them at this opportunity. Please hunt 20 Wild Hawkarrows from the Wanderer Plain. That should be enough for the Duriven Slugs not to handle them again. May there be spirit's revenge on those who turn turn their backs on you.

And the content of that cargo is my Hyren Family's Crest. By the request of my sister, Elder Sharin Hyren, of Tor Fortress, I ordered a large quantity of the family crest. While the merchants were bringing them, they were attacked by the Duriven Slugs and the crests were taken from them. It seems that the Duriven Slugs were going to blame nature for this, when they had attacked. We cannot allow them to have their way. What's fortunate is that our scouts have already found a great number of the trade items. Except our family crests, for they are not important enough to be recovered by mobilizing the guards. Therefore they should still be in their hands and I am hoping that they can be recovered. Of course, I trust that you will help me with this. Actually, if it's not you, there wouldn't be anyone who would take on this task. What do you think? Would you like to do it? Good. Then, catch Duriven Slugs at the Wanderer Plain and bring back 40 Hyren Crests from them. I am hoping that you'd thoroughly crush them so that they will not bother our merchants again. I entrust you with it. May there be spirit's revenge on those who turn their backs on you.	Catch Duriven Slugs at the Wanderer Plain and bring back 40 Hyren Crests from them.

You have gone through much trouble for the defense of the Tor Fortress, haven't you? But the fortress still requires your strength.</n>It seems that the Redflag Combatants on the Wanderer Plain are preparing for large-scale military action. But I don't think it's wise to allow such an exercise so close to the fortress. It may block the travel routes to other villages and cities, and it's quite likely to cause much unrest around here.</n>In fact, we could regard it as open hostility rather than just a military exercise. Also, there is no knowing just how much trouble they might cause if we let them proceed unhindered. So after considering all these factors, I've decided to issue an order as the Elder of the Tor Fortress to have them suppressed. And of course, I want you to partake in this campaign as well.</n>First, eliminate the <HFFFA7272>Earth Eights<HFFFFFFFF> on the <HFFFA7272>Dead Cliff<HFFFFFFFF> and use <HFFFA7272>Collecting Skill of Level 7 or higher<HFFFFFFFF> to obtain <HFFFA7272>2 Rare Skins<HFFFFFFFF>.

It's because they have always done similar activities at similar times. But to begin a preemptive expedition about an event that hasn't happened yet may only cause the Fortress residents to worry. By planting the image on the merchants that this is a dangerous area, it could cause a fiasco on the supplies to the Fortress. Therefore, unlike last time, we need to set forth with care. So we need an adventurer like you. Please eliminate 40 Redflag Combatants from Evor. That should be enough to keep them from having useless thoughts.

You haven't? Hm... According to the report of our scouts, Zefiran's Ghouls instigated other ghouls to assemble at the Hawks Plateau. It is probably for a type of ceremony regarding the Queen of the Dead. To them, the Queen of the Dead is like the queen bee surrounded by worker bees. But to leave them alone is too risky for the Fortress. So I am hoping that you will hunt them. Catch Zefiran at the Wanderer Plain and bring back 35 Ghouls' Claws.

After you eliminated Big Venom Ghouls from the  Hawks Plateau, our scouts were scouting that place, and we lost contact with them. Having sensed that the situation was not good, we sent out new scouts and discovered what shouldn't have been there. That is mustering up the already destroyed Big Venom Ghouls by the Ghoul King at the  Hawks Plateau. Ghoul King is truly a frightening monster. Completely different from Big Venom Ghouls in quality, he is an incredibly dangerous being. But to neglect him because he's so dangerous is also really dangerous. So we have to eliminate this Ghoul King. All military force is currently mobilized to clear away remaining Redflag Combatants and we don't have time to pick a new military force, so I am hoping you'll take care of this. Eliminate Ghoul King Borun? at the  Hawks Plateau and also eliminate 30 Big Venom Ghouls that are gathered around him. Please be careful.

It looks like you are looking for things to do. Yes. You came at a very good time. I hope that you can do some of my job. Hm. I am planning to make two personal ornaments since Sara Hyren's birthday is coming up; a lot of troublesome materials go into it.  But it won't seem right for a godfather who has looked after her since she was little to give a shabby gift, isn't it? So, I called you because I want to ask for your help. I hope you listen to it without thinking that this will be troublesome. Thank you for listening. So, there should be a stone called Magic Stone at the Windrill Eastern Entrance. It's a material that goes into the ornaments as its basis. So can you get some for me? What kind of ornament needs such a thing? I was planning to make a necklace following your, MoonElf's, tradition. Well, it's stone that's easily visible to the eye so you should be able to get it without much difficulty, so please hurry back with it. If the birthday passes, the effect of making it will diminish.

Hmm…… If my memory serves me right, you will see monsters called Sword Turkavens on the Wanderer Plain. Their feathers become pretty fine ornaments after some treatment.

What is it? It's just that the special material that I ordered for the necklace. They seem to be getting attacked by the Wild Hawkarrows at the Wanderer Plain that they seem to be suffering without being able to enter Tor Fortress. To aid them, I told the guards, but the guards have so much to do that they seem to be running a little late. So you need to use your strength. No matter how much I look for it, there doesn't seem to be anyone with your ability around here. Since you are helping me anyway, would you help me with this too? I knew you would help me.

I cannot leave him like that. The other transporter says that at the place where Sword Turkavens appear frequently, they got attacked by them and ran away leaving only him. So, can you catch the Sword Turkavens and give him some time to get away. Can you just catch 55 Sword Turkavens at the Wanderer Plain? I know that you will accept it. Thank you.

Oh, seriously; in such times as this, I think about why I decided to become a safe keeper. Ah ah; Of course, that doesn't mean that I'm planning to quit this job.

Crystal of Darkness is only formed if the sand that the Trancorpse Sins eat remain for a long time in the stomach of the Trancorpse Sin and receive the energy of darkness. So, if you catch Trancorpse Sin, you will be able to get very small probability. Of course, it won't do you any good to catch anything.

It's very hard to hear such a refreshing answer around here. There are many travelers that are so petty. That's right, this is no time to talk about that. Yes. Hey. I have a request.

But for the life of me, I cannot figure out what that was for. Well, I sent the detailed story in the letter all you have to do is bring back the reply from him. You can do it, right?

But there is a high probability that it was a place of residence for a group of monsters. The fact that it was discovered now is because either the monsters have moved or the monsters who lived there all died. So that is probably why Mr. Toray was able to spot the empty area. Since before then, it was a residence of dangerous monsters, not a grave or an excavation. Anyway, if my guess is correct, I'm positive that it was the residence of a group of Black Hawkarrows. And all of them who lived there probably moved to a different place. But I cannot confirm that with just this information. So I'm hoping that you can help me. First, hunt 40 Black Hawkarrows from the Windrill Eastern Entrance. And if you go to Hideback Village Grave Robber, Toray and tell him what I said, he will be able to check the traces.

I don't really want to touch it anymore. But, it doesn't feel right to just leave it; I need something appropriate to block it… That's right! There was that. You have some time right now, right?

Of course, I don't mean that it will be difficult for you. I guess I should call it a hassle for you. What is it? It is to eliminate 30 Trancorpse Sins from the Wanderer Plain. What do you think? Is it a dull job? But if you do it for the beginner archers, it shouldn't be that dull. I gave the beginner archers a task and that is to catch Trancorpse Sins. But, if I send them out as is, all of them might die. That's not such a good thing, is it? So you must help them a little. Of course, it doesn't mean anything if you help them right in front of them. What I want is for you to go to that place first and eliminate them. Then, I will go there furtively and unleash some of the very weak ones. If we do that, the beginner archers will be able to catch them easily. And their confidence will increase too. Isn't confidence the most important thing for an archer? Ooh ha ha ha!

Apparently, the feathers from monsters called Dark Wings do not provoke the monsters to attack my customers, unlike the skins.</n>The reason for that is unknown, but perhaps the monsters avoid attacking because those Dark Wings are very powerful monsters. If it's true, then it would be perfect for me. After all, you carry a weapon to deal with emergency situations.

There was an exceptionally powerful monster among them who had a premonition that the Queen of the Dead will be defeated at the last battle, so his army didn't participate in the battle and he took them elsewhere. And until recently, that monster did not reveal his identity. In order to make the power of Queen of the Dead as his own, he disturbed us. Yes. From the rumor of the dissolution of the seal of the Queen of the Dead to the rumor that there is something behind it. All of it was his doing. That monster's name is Aralman; he's a powerful Euriale Slaughterer. If possible, I want to destroy that powerful monster right now, but it's not such a simple problem. But there is a way. First, eliminate 40 Euriale Slaughterers at the Windrill Eastern Entrance and go to Tor Fortress Elder Sharin Hyren. She will help you. May the spirit's guidance shed light on your path.

According to our scouts' report, Aralman is currently leading his army at the Scorching Edge. Although I want to gather all of the military force to eliminate him, the damage to us will be great, and it won't be helpful at all. So there is a need to weaken the army of Aralman. For that, we need a competent adventurer like you. Please eliminate 10 Aralman Guards and 20 Aralman Soldiers at the Windrill Eastern Entrance. Starting with you, several adventurers were thrown into this. It may not be a bad thing to work with them, but since everyone will be hiding their identity, it may not be so easy.

If we eliminate these guys and recover their Swords to display them, I think that it's the best way to proceed to break the morale of Aralman's army. In order to do that, we need courageous and highly skilled adventurers. You are one of the few who has both qualities. Please hunt 20 Euriale Slaughterers and eliminate Duriven Fallens at the Windrill Eastern Entrance and bring back 8 Duriven Swords.

This lonely village is located in the middle of the desert and there's nothing surrounding it, so we're vulnerable from all directions.

When Toray meets adventurers he likes, he gives them his own letter of introduction. At least the letter shows he trusts you, but what he said is true.

If the potion taker doesn't use a certain stimulant, he'll fall asleep and starve to death. It's hard to find that kind of stimulant these days, but the sorcerer said we can get some from the Cave Wings in Cave Town. Since Cave Wings are so voracious, they will eat almost everything in the cave. We have no choice but to expect that the stimulant may remain in their stomach. Please, destroy the Cave Wings and find the Stimulant of the Cavemen!	There's a rumor that Cave Wings are bats domesticated by Cavemen.

Many people wrote epics and songs about that battle. The most famous is the Gallitos Series. Have you ever heard about those books? It was written by a renowned sorcerer, Gallitos. The songs and images were both superb, but most intriguing is the magic spell. They say Gallitos hid a powerful spell among the passages of the story, but nobody has ever found it. The whole reason I came to this village was those books, but I haven't yet acquired a single page. There's a rumor that they might be hidden in nearby Cave Town or the Debris of the Muted Site. I paid travelers to search all over the place but still nobody has turned up anything. Now that I've met you, I want to ask you, will you destroy thirty-five Lance Turkavens in the ruins so I can search there myself?	I won't ask anything more than this.

One of the travelers told me some small villages have their own festivals, and through these festivals the people of the villages are brought together. I think it's a brilliant idea. We haven't had this kind of festival before, so people are unfamiliar with the idea. I need to promote it and I need some help. It would be best to visit the people in the village one by one...

When Yaran was alive, it ate a whole lot of travelers whole, so after it died, many treasures were found in its body. But there are several significant objects yet to be found. The most famous one is Chester's Helmet. The helmet belonged to a well-known knight named Chester. It's one of the MoonElves' things and has a strong resistance to the magic of the Elementals. Recently, a member of the MoonElf nobility asked me to find it. In order to do that, I'll need to attach the Search Talisman to a tree in Yaran. Can you do that for me? I'll reward you. Oh, and you'll be able to hear me talk to you through the talisman.	You can't just put this anywhere, be careful. Attach this Search Talisman to a tree in Yaran.

If the seals are broken, Yaran may absorb the evil energy into its bones and transform itself into an even stronger monster. We checked the seals regularly, but there's never been a problem, they were still holding well. Recently my servant told me one of the seals was damaged.

I'm from Tabuto Village, the village of the Balcksmiths. About fifty years, all the greatest Blacksmiths in the village worked together to create the best sword on the continent. We named it 'Barracuda' and it was a truly spectacular weapon. Unfortunately, behind our backs one of the Blacksmiths infused the sword with his evil will. As soon as it was finished, the Evil Sword devastated the village, then disappeared. We were never sure where the Sword went, but we think it crossed the lake. Ever since the dark power came from Nothernland, rumors of evil have been all around, and we're worried our sword will be involved. We've decided to make a weapon to destroy Barracuda. To succeed, we need Irulda's Hammer. My collegues were bringing it here, but monsters killed all of them and stole the hammer. I'm sure something evil is behind all this, but we have to start somewhere. For the first step, please destroy the Pharaoh Slaves who took the Hammer at the Wave Dune, and retrieve the Hammer! You must help us!	Destroy the Pharaoh Slaves at the Wave Dune, and retrieve Irulda's Hammer!	Thank you.

I don't know how, but he saw that the Village couldn't last long. He gave two Staffs to the Village Chief and said the village would survive as long as it kept the Staffs well. But something happened fifty years ago and the village ceased to exist. Nob has remained silent about what happened, so we have no clues. Recently, the Orcs of Trilgard have been searching for the two Staffs while they're tracking Ugdrasil. The Tabuto Villagers had set up three Tombstones to commemorate Ugdrasil's visit, and the Tombstones held the records of the incident. Sadly they've been destroyed. Only rubble remains. Still, the Tombstone pieces will be helpful, so I'd like to ask you a favor. Please collect three Tombstone Pieces from the rocks and trees near Tabuto Village.

It's the very place where Nathan and Walcure fought each other, and where Broomhart reappeared. Many people say the desert got its name because it was made within a decade due to the drastic desertification of Windrill. Well, it's very easy to get lost there, as the desert is vast. The region near Meteora is even called the Lost Direction Road, so many people get lost there. So we have put the Gleaming Flag on the rock gate at the entrance of the Desert so Travelers can find their way here even in the dark. While the flag is there, the travelers can keep their bearings and find their way out of the desert, but every time there's a sandstorm, the flag blows away, and the flag we hung a few months ago is gone now. So I'd like to ask you a favor. I'll give you this new Gleaming Flag. Hang it on the rock gate east of the Giant's Highroad. Oh, the communication talisman is attached to the Flag, so you'll be able to listen to my words there.	You will easily find the rock gate once you get there. So hang this Gleaming Flag on the rock gate east of the Giant's Highroad.	I found the rock gate and hung the Flag. When the Flag started moving in the wind, faint light spread through the air along with the quiet bell sound. That's when the headman's voice was heard. Good job! All we can do now is hope the Flag won't be blown off by a stronger wind. Hey, this just occurred to me. I have one last favor to ask you.			3541	Gleaming Flag	1																																			1.

Maybe you'll need to get that pouch and take it to the Headman Yon who is in the North East of the village.	He definitely said it could be found at the stone in the South of Meteora so it should be here somewhere. You have to find the traveller's pouch and go to  the Headman Yon who is in the North East of the village.	Well done.

If you dig in Meteora, you can find something called Meteor Crystal. Sorcerers value it more than gold, but it's difficult to collect. The crystal disintegrates if it touches iron or steel, so you can't use a normal shovel. Sorcerer Roin has asked me to make him a special tool for getting Meteor Crystal.

3428	Family Sword	Rumors about the Relic	Hideback; Ferr	1		67							<Merchant> Ferr	<Grave Robber> Toray				If you go to the Ten Year Desert, there's a place called Village of the Shadows. Humans established it long ago in times of conflict. On the outside, it looks like a place where bandits live, but in fact it's an outpost to observe the Orcs. When Ugdrasil raised his army, he of course didn't leave the place intact. The legend goes that after half a day of battle, all Humans guarding the village died, but the Leader Lan Sand displayed bravery until the very end. So Ugdrasil highly praised his valor and buried Lan Sand's Sword under the earth of Village of the Shadows to protect the land even after his death. Recently, a descendant of Lan Sand asked me to find the sword. I don't like to get involved in this kind of work, but I think the descendant's request is justifiable. So I said yes, but I'm not used to such work. Grave Robber Toray, north of this village, knows much about the relics near the village. Give him a Gorgon Potion and get information.	This may be a difficult task, but please help me. Give one Gorgon Potion to Grave Robber Toray north of the village and get information.	This is the Gorgon Potion!

I'm sure it's proper for the descendants of the Sand Family to want the sword, but I don't think it belongs to anyone anymore. It's been a servant of petty wars for so long, it deserves a respectable rest, so I decided to commit this Sword to the Elementals, giving up the great fortune I could have made by selling it. I need you to help me. If you go South East of the Village you can find one peculiar-looking rock sticking out there. You can commit the Sword to the Elementals through that rock. Please do as I ask!	Offer the Sand Family's Sword on the rock at Giants Highroad. There must be a reply from the Elementals.	I put the Sword on the rock and took a step back.

As the name implies, Ogres live there, which makes it a very dangerous place. Ogres are feared by everyone because they eat just about every living creature they can fit in their mouths. I was wondering how to erase the village from the map, so I asked my man to spy on them. I communicate with him via letters at the mid-point between Terranoa and the village on a regular basis, but a courier of mine who went out to get the letter yesterday isn't back yet. He wouldn't have run away with the letter. I believe he was eaten by a monster. We can't do anything about the dead, so we should try to concern ourselves with those who are still alive. I would like you to go get the letter. There's an Old Fallen Tree, hollow inside, southwest of Wuthering. Bring back the Ogre Village Report from there.	Hurry up.

I can't tell you exactly what it is, but there is an item of great value in the Ogre Village. Its previous owner must have been eaten by the Ogres.</n>The Ogres however, do not find the item particularly useful and are keeping it in one of the cellars of the village, but retrieving it is rather difficult, apparently. Stealing it would be inadvisable, as it is too bulky and heavy to retrieve without getting caught. So he suggested luring the Ogres out of the village.</n></n>We must do something now, so there isn't much time to think about it. Please help us with this. I think <HFFFA7272>2 Finest Tails<HFFFFFFFF> would be the most appropriate bait to lure them out with.

They're big eaters, so one Ogre ate all the meat. We'll need a tremendous amout of meat to lure the Ogres. Let's give up the previous plan. Instead, my man has made an excellent proposal. In Ogre Village, there are four Small Skull Towers besides the Bone Tower at the center. Ogres hang up the skulls of the victims that they've eaten. The skulls are very important to them. According to my man, if you run away with a skull, all the Ogres will chase you. But the problem is, I have no man brave enough to step up and do that. Judging by the circumstances, only you can do it. Please. Steal four Talking Skulls from the four Small Skull Towers inside the Ogre Village.	You could fall prey to the Ogres, so be careful.

But if we do nothing, then we'll really feel stupid, so I'd like to try another proposal made by one of my men. Ogres are on bad terms with the monsters nearby, but they cooperate with Rock Stormers a bit. There's just one reason behind the cooperation. Ogres can't eat Rock Stormers. So, if we attack the Rock Stormers, wouldn't Ogres come help? Although it seems like a foolish plan, we have no other choice. Destroy forty Rock Stormers west of the Land of Loss.	At this point, I'll try anything! It's that precious. Go destroy forty Rock Stormers west of the Land of Loss.	Frankly speaking, I didn't expect much, and indeed it was pointless.

Although it's a powerful painkiller, Forma's Leaves sometimes have a terrible side effect. My son can't wake up from a deep sleep! If I just leave him like that, he'll eventually die... But there is one way to awaken him. The Hira Tribe uses a strong stimulant, but they won't just give it away. You have to take it from them. This task is really dangerous.

I'm fed up with his foolishness. You know, this time he came up with a major plot against us. I received information that he's concocting a plan that may influence our entire city. I don't know the specifics, but I'm sure he'll be controlling the Monsters as usual. I'll be able to better grasp the situation if I can intercept just one letter Ayorg sent to the monsters. He's mostly in contact with Hira Tribe. They have their own traditions, so the Hira Tribe may be easy to control and they would probably easily understand the language. Well, I hope you can get the letter for me. Bring me Ayorg's Plan from the rock at Sand Road!	I will not tolerate any plots that threaten the city.

Terranoa doesn't have a standing army, so if monsters walk right into the middle of town, the city will be devastated.

Don’t you want to receive the ancestors' spirit and travel the continent? Then, there are a few things you need to know first. One of them is getting to know the most basic residents in this continent. These are residents that all travelers get to meet frequently. I'll introduce you to a merchant.

Please go and find Merchant Darryl, who is in the center of the village.	The chief sent you right? He always introduces the merchants to the beginners. What you're doing is following the guidance of the elements. The merchant usually sells a various types of potions, consumption items.

Well, you're also a new traveler. Did Darryl send you? If so, you'll have a lot of things to learn. When traveling, you'll seldom find a reinforcement potion. There is a low chance that you'll obtain one so they are traded at a very high price in the Auction House. Buff potions affect armor.

However, a different cooking skill is required for each dish so you'll need to learn the appropriate skill for the dish that you require. You'll be able to learn these skills directly from the cook.

If you're curious as to whether or not you've learnt the skill properly then make 1 Soup of Attack by yourself. You'll find out which ingredients you'll need in the course of learning this skill. Now, show your ability to me!	Please hurry! Make 1 Soup of Attack	Hmm.. Let's see.. Wow, you do have some great talents! This is really close to being the perfect Soup of Attack. Well done.

Hmm.. which would be better... O.k. If you catch 10 Lizardmen from the Southeast of Delfaras, then you'll understand what I mean!	Well, you have to eat that first and then hunt to actually experience that ability! So eat the Soup of Attack and bring me 10 Lizardmen from the Southeast of Delfaras	How was it?

You can get it from Merchant Bless who is on the West side of the Delfaras Square.	Don't hesitate.

I'm quite disappointed that the extent of its real value is being downgraded as everyone's learning it these days. Even you! Do you actually have the ability to learn the skill or are you one of those who are just following the latest trends? If you are then give it up now. Why is alchemy so important? Huh.. you don't know anything do you? I'll teach you its great power! But before I do that, I need a Potion. Create and bring me 1 deer Potion with the alchemy skill that you've just learned. You'll need to get the necessary materials by yourself!	I just want to see your alchemy skills! Please make and bring me 1 deer Potion.	Well, let's see. Hmm.. Not bad at all.

You don't believe me do you? Well then try it out for yourself! I'll tell you what to do. We need some materials for alchemy, but the Lizardmen are preventing us from doing this. Please catch 15 Lizardman Heros that appear in the Miracle Fountain vicinity. Well, of course by transforming into a deer, you'll understand what I mean!	You turn into a deer when you drink the deer Potion! So when you're a deer, kill 15 Lizardman Heros in the Miracle Fountain vicinity.	How was it? Did you experience the effect? The Potions can be very useful in some instances so learn the skill, and don't be lazy! Learning one more skill can be very helpful in this terrible world!

This village is a small but cozy place which may not seem that special, but has the longest history of all the Orc villages. If you want to follow the spirits of your ancestors and travel around the Chantra continent, there are things that you need to know first. I'd like to tell you about the most basic residents here. There are residents that all of the travelers need to meet. I'm going to introduce you to a merchant. Please go and visit Merchant Zion in the center of the village. He will teach you about the kind of things that he does.	You will be meeting that merchant frequently during the course of your journey so why don't you take the time to get to know him better? Go and visit Merchant Zion in the center of the village	You were sent by the elder! He's always very kind, introducing the new travelers to the merchants. By doing that he's actually following the guidance of the Elements. Life and Mana potions are the things that travelers who battle monsters look for most of the time. Getting these from the monsters has its limits so they tend to buy a lot of potions whenever they come to see us. We do sell other various items though, not just potions, so please come around every now and then to check what we have. We're usually located in most places even in small villages.																																								1.

He doesn't do that much for the travelers but there is one thing that he does which we cannot do without. Please go and see him to find out what that is. Blacksmith Brin Ironmasher is in the northeast of the village.	You'll probably be able to meet merchants and blacksmiths wherever you go. Both merchants and blacksmiths are crucial for travelers' survival. Find Blacksmith Brin Ironmasher in the northeast of the village to find out more.	You're a traveler who was sent by Zion! Hmm, then I guess you'll have a lot of things that you're not sure about yet. When you start traveling around, you'll occasionally find a 'Reinforcement Potion'. Because this item is so rare, it's traded at a very high price in the auction houses. That potion itself is fairly useless, but a skilled blacksmith like me can use it to improve weapons and armor. Keep that in mind and don't forget to visit the blacksmith when you find a reinforcement potion. Ah, also please keep in mind that one reinforcement potion is consumed per use so think carefully before you decide to use the item.																																								1.

It's still worth finding out what he does directly from him, so please go and see Safe Keeper Tess in the west of the village.	You'll find out when you meet. Go and see Safe Keeper Tess in the west of the village.	You look like a new traveler. Do you have any items that you want me to look after for you? Oh, I see. If you are an Orc beginner, you have to show you're interested in finding out more about the village. It's a suicidal to just arrogantly jump into combat. You don't know how dangerous it is outside the gate! I'm starting to ramble on a bit. My job as the Safe Keeper is to keep the valuables safe. We keep travelers' items inside this box. There is a finite amount of space, but it's a good idea to keep the valuable items here. I heard that you can loot other travelers' items after killing them, so if you don't want this to happen to you, it would be a good idea to leave the items with a Safe Keeper like me.																																								1.

You'll have opportunities to meet the merchants specific to certain classes in the future. First though, you'll need to know about the item trader. Go and see Item Trader Morien who is in front of the village.	Some travelers will claim that they don't really need help from the item traders, but the traders play an important role in helping this continent to run more smoothly. Go and see Item Trader Morien who is in front of the village.	You're new here aren't you? Then I doubt that you have any items that I can trade? What's that? The Safe Keeper told you to see me? Well, it is a good idea to get to know me if you want to make the most out of your adventures. Travelers trade all sorts of items for varying prices through me. If you're lucky you may snap up some real bargains, or even items that you won't get from the standard merchants.

The chief sent you to us because it is essential that you know us. There are people like the chief wherever you go who represent their village, but they tend to grant more quests than anyone else because they know more of what goes on. So pay attention to the chiefs wherever you go. Now let's stop this chit chat, go and find Elder Brusoto in the central village.	Everyone has their own stories so you can receive quests from many people. But, what I'm trying to say is that you should pay more attention to the chiefs because they are the ones with most of the quests. Now, go and find Elder Brusoto in the center of the village.	So you've met all of the merchants then? Remember, even though they won't be able to help you on the battlefields, without them you can't expect your life and assets to be protected.

As you may know already, this village is located in a secluded place, so the connection with the outside is minimal. The journey that you're going to take now is very different from the comfortable life you had here. If you want to get used to the traveling, then there are so many things that you need to know. The most basic of that knowledge is knowing the kind of skills that are helpful to you. I'll tell you about them. I'd like to introduce a merchant to you among others the travelers commonly meet. Please go and find Merchant Giridium who is located in the south east of the village. He will tell you the details about what he does.	Merchants can be a travelers best friend. So, learn about them while you have the chance. Visit Merchant Giridium who is located in the south east of the village.	You were sent by the Elder! He's always very kind to introduce new travelers to the Merchants. Life and Mana potions are the things that travelers who hunt monsters need the most. Getting them from the monsters can often result in deficient supplies during the heat of battle, so they tend to buy a lot every time they come and visit us. We also buy and sell various other items so come back to visit any time. Let's help each other out!																																								1.

To find out what that is, go and ask the Blacksmith Ayre in the west of the village will be waiting for you.	You'll be able to meet Merchants and Blacksmiths wherever you go. These people are very important to the travelers. If you want to know the reason, please go and see Blacksmith Ayre in the west of the village.	Oh, you're a new traveler? Then you still have much to learn. You will occasionally obtain a 'Reinforcement Potion' during the course of your travel. The likelihood of obtaining the Reinforcement Potion is very low so they are often traded at a very price in the auction house. The Potion on its own is completely useless but through a Blacksmith like me, it becomes a very valuable tool to upgrade your weapons and armor. Oh, another thing. One bottle is consumed per use, so remember to use them with discretion.																																								1.

It will be better to talk to him in person to find out what he does in more detail. Go and find Safe Keeper Firnelli in the center of the village.	You'll know when you meet him. Please go and find Safe Keeper Firnelli in the center of the village	A Safe Keeper keeps your deposits safe (as our name would suggest). The size of the depository is limited so you can't keep putting things in there indefinitely. It is a good idea to keep valuable items here. I heard that others can take your items if you are defeated in battle, so if you don't want that to happen, it would be best to leave the items with me in advance.																																								1.

Please go and find Item Trader Ferde in South East of the village.	Some travelers don't really seem to need item traders, but they play an important role in making the continent run more smoothly. Please go and talk to the Item Trader Ferde in southeast of the village.	I haven't seen you before You don't have any items that I can trade do you? You were sent here by the Safe Keeper? Well, if you want to enjoy your travel, it's a good idea to get to know me. Travelers trade items with each other through item traders like myself. There are all sorts of items at various prices. If you're lucky you might be able to get some items at a lower price than the general merchants. You can register an item from your own inventory. You can see the 'Sell' button below on your inventory can't you? So if you place the item in one of the slots that appear when you press 'Sell', the item is automatically registered on our trader's sale list.

They are the ones who know most about what goes on in the village, so they tend to grant more quests than anyone else. Pay attention to the chiefs or elders wherever you go. Well, let's stop this chit chat. Go and find Elder Bosren in the north of the village.	Quests are not always granted by the elders. But pay attention to the elders and chiefs as they tend to have the most quests in that village. Go and see Elder Bosren in the North of the village	So you've met all of the merchants?

Well, you'll know the difference only when you eat and try hunting for yourself! So please eat the Soup of Attack and hunt down 10 Young Vampires from the Path of Glory.

He went to find out about it himself but had the misfortune of running into her. He ran for his life and barely managed to escape the clutches of that heinous beast, but the place he took refuge was the Village of Seethe of all places.

But there are also things I lost to obtain this piece of information. I wouldn't be imposing too much on you if I were to ask you to find it for me, I hope?</n>Thank you for agreeing so readily. As I didn't have any clue to start with, I had to search all over the Asylum and somewhere along the away I lost my most precious necklace. It was given to me by the person I love, who is waiting for me back at home. But while I was fighting a Cevent, the string tore and the rascal took the necklace.</n></n>So what I want you to do is simple.

In exchange for giving some of the souls she collected for Ignatus, she managed to list her name on the Vampires' clan register. And that is how the current Cuirinia was born.</n></n>A way to take away her immortality? Well. There is no way to find out, at this point. But the Code of the Vampire might help.</n>There is the <HFFFA7272>Statue of the Vampire Goddess<HFFFFFFFF> in one of the rooms in the eastern section of the <HFFFA7272>Asylum<HFFFFFFFF>. You will find that the statue is holding the <HFFFA7272>Code of the Vampire<HFFFFFFFF>. I hope you can find some clues in there.</n>There is no use bringing that to me, so go straight to <HFFFA7272>Elder Mybling<HFFFFFFFF> who is standing in front of a door in <HFFFA7272>Western Ellore<HFFFFFFFF> once you get it.

2811	Attack of Cuirinia	The Curse	Ellore; Mybling	3		54				1	2810	Power of Immortality	<Elder> Mybling	<Physician> Mediterus				Ah how could this be?</n>It looks like Cuirinia caught wind of what we've been up to. It must be the Vampires who found out about it……. I wonder if that's the reason for the recent turn of events? Cuirinia has stepped up the pace of collecting souls. More and more travelers are falling victim to her.</n>Vanquishing Cuirinia is our priority but first we must save the victims here. Cuirinia is collecting the souls through a curse. When a victim suffers a mortal wound by one of Cuirinia's monsters, instead of dying immediately the victim's soul is gradually sucked out. And that soul ends up in the clutches of Cuirinia, Ferguson says.</n>The only way to stop the soul from seeping out is to revive the victim before he or she dies completely. But that is impossible, even with the powers of the Elementals here in Ellore. They can only slow down the process.</n></n>I can only think of one person in a time like this. You. Leave immediately for <HFFFA7272>Trilgard<HFFFFFFFF> in Ezerock, the domain of the Orcs. You will find <HFFFA7272>Physician Mediterus<HFFFFFFFF> in <HFFFA7272>North part<HFFFFFFFF> of the city. Explain to him the situation here and ask for his help!	As I said, even the power of the Gaia Tree Le Sidul can only manage to delay death a little. There is no time for you to be idling away! Go and request for help from <HFFFA7272>Physician Mediterus<HFFFFFFFF> in <HFFFA7272>Northern Trilgard<HFFFFFFFF> in Ezerock!	Hic. What is it? That hurried attitude of yours I don't find it particularly pleasing. A patient must calm down, first. Hic.</n></n>Hmm. So basically you are saying that you are not a patient. That's it then, I have no time to spare for patients in distant lands as well. Off with you, then.</n></n>Whoa. You are one persistent fellow. I have already heard about Cuirinia. So there's no need for you to be so long-winded about it. Right, let us go through the important parts, then. Hic.																																								1.

Hmm. I have been researching about that absurd land for a long time now. Hic. The force of darkness has always been the root of all diseases, you know?</n>But this was too much for just one man, so I and a couple of friends of mine studied together for a long time before we reached a solution. Dozens of patients had died during that time but I don't think it was too big a price to pay if I could save the lives of hundreds in times to come. Listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you. Hic.</n></n>The ones that caused the problem this time are the Satyros in the Village of Seethe. I need the soil from the land they live on. And while I get it, I need you to fend off the Satyros for me. Do you understand? While you hunt the Satyros, I'll dig out the soil from the ground nearby.</n>To put it simply, take care of <HFFFA7272>25 Satyros Deaths<HFFFFFFFF> and <HFFFA7272>25 Satyros Guardians<HFFFFFFFF> in the <HFFFA7272>Village of Seethe<HFFFFFFFF>.

While you were away, Ferguson deciphered the Code of the Vampire that you brought and discovered a number of things.</n>According to the Code, Cuirinia's eternal life is linked directly to the life of that Vampire. It means that as long as the Vampire that made the Contract of Blood with Cuirinia is alive, she will come back to life again and again.</n></n>So killing that Vampire will break the Contract rendering Cuirinia mortal once again. So have we solved the problem, then? Unfortunately not. We have no idea on who the Vampire that formed the Contract of Blood with Cuirinia might be.</n>But Wilcott in the Asylum did make an interesting suggestion. He said that when Cuirinia dies even though she will be resurrected a sign will appear on the Vampire that is in Contract with her. He says that he will look out for that sign, so he wants us to kill Cuirinia.</n></n>You understand why I'm telling you this, right? I am asking you to take care if this.

All that remains now is putting a permanent end to her life.</n></n>Oh, and there is one other thing I want you to take care of. Cuirinia should have an item with her called the Bead of Nothernland. It is the object that absorbs souls. If that object remains intact then even after you kill her we may have to face yet another Cuirinia.

The fact that they aren't living here in Ellore also tells you are that they don't find forests comfortable, either.</n>At a loss as what to do, they appealed to the king of Tullan for help but were flatly refused.

This should be enough to convince the king.</n>And even if we didn't have this tombstone piece, there is a reason why we must believe that Usus is dead.

His hoard is vast, apparently even greater than what the king has in his royal treasury.</n></n>The king does desire those treasures, but he feels that should Usus still be alive, he may use them to pose a threat. I don't know how I should say this, but the king is actually in fear of Usus.</n></n>Anyway, since his death is confirmed the king will soon claim his treasures. Then we must hurry.

I just heard something very galling, and I want you to confirm it for me.</n>Is it true that there are treasures left by Usus after his death, and Trilgard wants them all? And is it also true that you helped them to do it?</n></n>What you did was very foolish! Who said those treasures only belong to Trilgard? The mercenaries from our village went through so much trouble to hunt down Usus, you know. At least half, if not all, of the treasures should come to us. Do you get me?</n></n>I see that you grasp what I'm saying. Then you must make amends for your folly. Do you see this chest? Inside this chest are the treasures of Usus brought by those blackguards from Trilgard. I had a crafty guy to steal it from them.</n>But the problem is that we don't have a key to open this. There is one General Beacon of Trilgard is always wearing on his hips, but even we can't touch that. But it is too early to feel disappointed. I know someone who has an exceptional tool that can open any lock.</n></n>But once again, that person is also a resident of Trilgard. So we have no choice but to steal that, too.

I need more!</n>I see that you get what I'm saying. Then I shall give you another order.</n></n>I think the rest of Usus's hoard is buried somewhere in the Ghost Valley. I say this because soldiers from Trilgard are busy at work in there, right now. But it appears that they lost a treasure chest they dug up to the Lamia Ladies inhabiting the area. As you are aware, Lamia love anything that is made of gold!</n>Anyway, Trilgard hasn't been able to recover that chest till now. I say, this is the time for us to act.

For the treasure of Usus, no other reason. They took the treasure chest I worked so hard to get.</n></n>Hmph. Yes, I'm aware. I am well aware that it all started when I first stole the thing that belonged to the cads in Trilgard. But as I said before, why should the king of Trilgard have the treasure of Usus? Basically I cooked some fine food only to feed the dogs.</n>Ah, how mortifying. I just can't sleep when I think about it. Just how much treasure was inside that chest? I am so anxious to know.</n>Here is an order for you. Go straight to <HFFFA7272>Mayor Prosto<HFFFFFFFF> in <HFFFA7272>Eastern Trilgard<HFFFFFFFF> right now and ask him about the treasure. Surely I deserve something after all this!	I can't just stay here and do nothing. Go to <HFFFA7272>Mayor Prosto<HFFFFFFFF> in <HFFFA7272>Eastern Trilgard<HFFFFFFFF> and ask him about my share of the treasure. If he refuses to give me my share, then I will lead mercenaries and storm the place.	What brings you here?</n></n>Huoh…… Are you somehow involved with the treasures of Usus, as well? My, has it gotten complicated.</n>It is unfortunate for Koop, but there is no treasure. Well, it's unfortunate for us as well, but……. You want to know what happened? Well, I will tell you if you want to know.																																								1. Visit Mayor Prosto in Trilgard.												663	Explosion Scroll	4																45330	863300	2870	Fooled

All we found inside the chest was a letter. One that was written by Usus. I was just racking my head over how I should report this to the king.</n>The letter? I'll read it out for you.</n></n>'To those who celebrated with joy believing the rumor of my death to be genuine, I have this to say to you. I shall leave big footprints before I die. Remember that those who have done nothing for the pride of the Orcs have no right to touch the treasure!'</n></n>Well, so that's how it is. It seems that the rumor of Usus's death was also false, based on this letter. I have no idea what is going on. I'll need to carry out more investigations.</n>Please tell that to Koop, as well. Since he might refuse to believe you, I'll lend you this <HFFFA7272>Usus's Letter<HFFFFFFFF>. Show it to <HFFFA7272>Security Chief Koop<HFFFFFFFF> in <HFFFA7272>Western Zylok<HFFFFFFFF> and even with that dense head of his he should understand what the situation is.

What happened to my treasure?</n></n>Huh? What kind of foolish tale is that? There was no treasure, and Usus isn't dead, too? I will not be fooled by such an obvious lie.</n>A letter? Hmph. You bring that letter and you want me to believe it? Hand that over! It is my fault to entrust this matter to a feeble traveler like you.

Koop also likes to flaunt the traditions of the Orcs, but even he pales in comparison to them. They also attack other Orcs, but they are especially ruthless to other races.</n>So we always try to be careful whenever we pass near the area, but this time we were struck most unexpectedly. A friend of mine is in business with a band of Elves, and they were going to Windrill this time. And they were ambushed when they were nowhere near the Bandit Village. One of my friend's men who barely escaped told me what had happened, so in order to rescue them I asked your assistance to attack the Bandit Village.</n></n>But it was a complete failure. I couldn't even save a single one. If only we had a little more strength.</n>Nonetheless, we must inform the Elves of this as well. Please go and see <HFFFA7272>Guild Registrar Jean Kiev<HFFFFFFFF> in the <HFFFA7272>Eastern side of the Village<HFFFFFFFF>.	You must not delay in delivering the message.

So what I have been concerned about has finally happened. Those rascals in the Bandit Village are just too impertinent! They contribute absolutely nothing to this village. And the mercenaries here often collude with the bandits, as they are also Orcs. On top of that, Koop is hardly motivated to do anything about it. No, he might even be in league with them as well.</n>Thank you for letting me know, anyhow. But right now I just can't think of what I should be doing.

Actually, I should've asked this before we got started.</n></n>I know that you have been helping many people regardless of their race. Still, this isn't something we can take lightly as our lives are on the line.</n>Anyway, I got you. To tell you the truth, most Orcs would not agree with me. And there are many dangerous characters in the village. The one who concerns me the most is Kuro, however. He is more of a thief than a merchant. Blackmailing and swindling are just a couple of things that he's good at.</n>And it seems that he has caught wind of our plan. So we must bribe him somehow. It shouldn't be too difficult, as he's a scoundrel who would not care much for his own race if he can make some money out of it.</n></n>Give <HFFFA7272>10,000 Gold<HFFFFFFFF> to <HFFFA7272>Merchant Kuro<HFFFFFFFF> in the <HFFFA7272>Center of the Village<HFFFFFFFF> and try talking to him.

And recently I've been trying to bring in some decent merchandise……. I am not going to refuse if you are willing to provide some assistance.

I also heard this from another traveler, but apparently Mortar got the contract rings from the Asylum. The thing is, the contract rings from that place are also recorded in one of my books.

And the most famous of them all were those three youths I mentioned.</n>Sigh. Yes. There is a reason why I am referring to them in the past tense. All three youths were cruelly murdered a week ago. It was fortunate that their bodies were found before the desert scavengers got to them.</n></n>But there is much talk about who the culprit is. Currently, all three races want someone to get to the bottom of the murders of those young heroes. And the family of Carl, the Human, has asked me to be their proxy and find out the truth.

Sending you to the Asylum to hunt the Blood Shark Knights was a decoy tactic to expose those stealing information from Ferr.

It was the Kobolts, as we expected.</n></n>We managed to subjugate them with ease, but there is a more urgent problem. We are almost certain Amantorg is behind all of this. Fortunately for us, the Humans know nothing of this yet, so eliminating the monster will enable us to acquire the relic of Dikain.

I cannot entrust you with this task, as it is simply too important. I am sorry, but that's just the way it is.

He was a good adventurer who treated even a grave robber like me with kindness.

Monsters summoned by the curse of the orbs attacked him and he ended up losing his life.</n></n>Well, seeing how this has turned out I can't just continue to run like a coward, I guess.
